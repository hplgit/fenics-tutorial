Below we explain some key terms used in this tutorial.

  FEniCS: name of a software suite composed of many individual software
          components (see ``fenicsproject.org``). Some components are DOLFIN and
	  Viper, explicitly referred to in this tutorial. Others are
          FFC and FIAT, heavily used by the programs appearing in this tutorial,
          but never explicitly used from the programs.

  DOLFIN: a FEniCS component, more precisely a C++ library, with
          a Python interface, for performing important actions in finite element
          programs. DOLFIN makes use of many other FEniCS components and
          many external software packages.

  Viper:  a FEniCS component for quick visualization of finite element
          meshes and solutions.

  UFL:    a FEniCS component implementing the *unified form language*
          for specifying finite element forms in FEniCS programs.
          The definition of the forms, typically called ``a`` and ``L`` in
          this tutorial, must have legal UFL syntax. The same applies to
          the definition of functionals (see the section :ref:`tut:poisson1:functionals`).

  Class (Python): a programming construction for creating objects
          containing a set of variables and functions. Most
          types of FEniCS objects are defined through the class concept.

  Instance (Python): an object of a particular type, where the type is
          implemented as a class. For instance,
          ``mesh = UnitIntervalMesh(10)`` creates
          an instance of class ``UnitIntervalMesh``, which is reached by the
          name ``mesh``. (Class ``UnitIntervalMesh`` is actually just
          an interface to a corresponding C++ class in the DOLFIN C++ library.)

  Class method (Python): a function in a class, reached by dot
          notation: ``instance_name.method_name``

  argument ``self`` (Python): required first parameter in class methods,
         representing a particular object of the class.
         Used in method definitions, but never in calls to a method.
         For example, if ``method(self, x)`` is the definition of
         ``method`` in a class ``Y``, ``method`` is called as
         ``y.method(x)``, where ``y`` is an instance of class ``Y``.
         In a call like ``y.method(x)``, ``method`` is invoked with
         ``self=y``.

  Class attribute (Python): a variable in a class, reached by
         dot notation: ``instance_name.attribute_name``

Overview of objects and functions
---------------------------------

Most classes in FEniCS have an explanation of the purpose and usage
that can be seen by using the general documentation command
``pydoc`` for Python objects. You can type

.. index:: pydoc

.. code-block:: text

        pydoc dolfin.X

to look up documentation of a Python class ``X`` from the DOLFIN
library (``X`` can be ``UnitSquareMesh``, ``Function``,
``Viper``, etc.). Below is an overview of the most important classes
and functions
in FEniCS programs, in the order they typically appear within programs.

``UnitSquareMesh(nx, ny)``: generate mesh over the unit square
:math:`[0,1]\times [0,1]` using ``nx`` divisions in :math:`x` direction and
``ny`` divisions in :math:`y` direction. Each of the ``nx*ny`` squares
are divided into two cells of triangular shape.

``UnitIntervalMesh``, ``UnitCubeMesh``, ``UnitCircleMesh``, ``UnitSphere``,
``IntervalMesh``, ``RectangleMesh``, and ``BoxMesh``: generate mesh over
domains of simple geometric shape, see the section :ref:`tut:prepro`.

``FunctionSpace(mesh, element_type, degree)``:
a function space defined over a mesh, with a given element type
(e.g., ``'Lagrange'`` or ``'DG'``), with basis functions as polynomials of
a specified degree.

``Expression(formula, p1=v1, p2=v2, ...)``:
a scalar- or vector-valued function, given as a
mathematical expression ``formula`` (string) written in C++ syntax.
The spatial coordinates in the expression are named
``x[0]``, ``x[1]``, and ``x[2]``, while time and other
physical parameters can be represented as symbols ``p1``, ``p2``,
etc., with corresponding values ``v1``, ``v2``, etc., initialized
through keyword arguments. These parameters become attributes,
whose values can be modified when desired.

``Function(V)``: a scalar- or vector-valued finite element field in
the function space ``V``. If ``V`` is a ``FunctionSpace`` object,
``Function(V)`` becomes a scalar field, and with ``V`` as a
``VectorFunctionSpace`` object, ``Function(V)`` becomes a
vector field.

``SubDomain``: class for defining a subdomain, either a part of the
boundary, an internal boundary, or a part of the domain.
The programmer must subclass ``SubDomain`` and implement the
``inside(self, x, on_boundary)`` function
(see the section :ref:`tut:poisson1:impl`) for telling whether a
point ``x`` is inside the subdomain or not.

``Mesh``: class for representing a finite element mesh, consisting of
cells, vertices, and optionally faces, edges, and facets.

``MeshFunction``: tool for marking parts of the domain or the boundary.
Used for variable coefficients ("material properties", see
the section :ref:`tut:possion:2D:2mat:problem`) or for
boundary conditions (see the section :ref:`tut:poisson:mat:neumann`).

``DirichletBC(V, value, where)``: specification of Dirichlet (essential)
boundary conditions via a function space ``V``, a function
``value(x)`` for computing the value of the condition at a point ``x``,
and a specification ``where`` of the boundary, either as a
``SubDomain`` subclass instance, a plain function, or as a
``MeshFunction`` instance.
In the latter case, a 4th argument is provided to describe which subdomain
number that describes the relevant boundary.

``TestFunction(V)``: define a test function on a space ``V`` to be used
in a variational form.

``TrialFunction(V)``: define a trial function on a space ``V`` to be used
in a variational form to represent the unknown in a finite element problem.

``assemble(X)``: assemble a matrix, a right-hand side, or a functional,
given a from ``X`` written with UFL syntax.

``assemble_system(a, L, bcs)``: assemble the matrix and the right-hand
side from a bilinear (``a``) and linear (``L``) form written with UFL
syntax. The ``bcs`` parameter holds one or more ``DirichletBC`` objects.

``LinearVariationalProblem(a, L, u, bcs)``: define a variational problem,
given a bilinear (``a``) and linear (``L``) form, written with UFL
syntax, and one or more ``DirichletBC`` objects stored in ``bcs``.

``LinearVariationalSolver(problem)``: create solver object for a linear
variational problem object (``problem``).

``solve(A, U, b)``: solve a linear system with ``A`` as coefficient
matrix (``Matrix`` object), ``U`` as unknown (``Vector`` object),
and ``b`` as right-hand side (``Vector`` object).
Usually, ``U = u.vector()``, where
``u`` is a ``Function`` object representing the unknown finite
element function of the problem, while
``A`` and ``b`` are computed by calls to ``assemble``
or ``assemble_system``.

``plot(q)``: quick visualization of a mesh, function, or mesh function
``q``, using the Viper component in FEniCS.

``interpolate(func, V)``: interpolate a formula or finite
element function ``func`` onto the function space ``V``.

``project(func, V)``: project a formula or finite element function ``func``
onto the function space ``V``.

.. _tut:app:cpp:functions:

User-defined functions
----------------------

When defining a function in terms of a mathematical expression inside
a string formula, e.g.,

.. code-block:: python

        myfunc = Expression('sin(x[0])*cos(x[1])')

the expression contained in the first argument
will be turned into a C++ function
and compiled to gain efficiency. Therefore,
the syntax used in the expression must be valid C++ syntax.
Most Python syntax for mathematical expressions are also valid C++ syntax,
but power expressions make an exception: ``p**a`` must be written as
``pow(p,a)`` in C++ (this is also an alternative Python syntax).
The following mathematical functions can be used directly
in C++
expressions when defining ``Expression`` objects:
``cos``, ``sin``, ``tan``, ``acos``, ``asin``,
``atan``, ``atan2``, ``cosh``, ``sinh``, ``tanh``, ``exp``,
``frexp``, ``ldexp``, ``log``, ``log10``, ``modf``,
``pow``, ``sqrt``, ``ceil``, ``fabs``, ``floor``, and ``fmod``.
Moreover, the number :math:`\pi` is available as the symbol ``pi``.
All the listed functions are taken from the ``cmath`` C++ header file, and
one may hence
consult documentation of ``cmath`` for more information on the
various functions.

Parameters in expression strings must be initialized via keyword
arguments when creating the ``Expression`` object:

.. code-block:: python

        myfunc = Expression('sin(w_x*x[0])*cos(w_y*x[1])',
                             w_x=pi, w_y=2*pi)

.. _tut:app:solver:prec:

Linear solvers and preconditioners

The following solution methods for linear
systems can be accessed in FEniCS programs:

================  ============================================

======================  ==========================================  

Many of the choices listed above
are only offered by a specific backend, so setting the backend
appropriately is necessary for being able to choose a desired
linear solver or preconditioner.

An up-to-date list of the available solvers and preconditioners
in FEniCS can be produced by

.. code-block:: python

        list_linear_solver_methods()
        list_krylov_solver_preconditioners()

.. _tut:Epetra:

Using a backend-specific solver
-------------------------------


.. warning::
    The linear algebra backends in FEniCS have recently changed. This
    section is not yet up-to-date.




.. index:: down-casting matrices and vectors

.. index:: PETSc

The linear algebra backend determines the specific data structures
that are used in the ``Matrix`` and ``Vector`` classes. For example, with
the PETSc backend, ``Matrix`` encapsulates a PETSc matrix storage
structure, and ``Vector`` encapsulates a PETSc vector storage structure.
Sometimes one wants to perform operations directly on (say) the
underlying PETSc objects. These can be fetched by

.. code-block:: python

        A_PETSc =
        down_cast(A).mat() b_PETSc = down_cast(b).vec() U_PETSc =
        down_cast(u.vector()).vec()

Here, ``u`` is a ``Function``, ``A`` is a
``Matrix``, and ``b`` is a ``Vector``.  The same syntax applies if we want
to fetch the underlying Epetra, uBLAS, or MTL4 matrices and vectors.

.. ../../../la/trilinos/python/demo.py

.. index:: Trilinos

.. index:: Epetra

Sometimes one wants to implement tailored solution algorithms, using
special features of the underlying numerical packages.
Here is an example where we create an ML preconditioned Conjugate
Gradient solver by programming with Trilinos-specific objects directly.
Given a linear system
:math:`AU=b`, represented by a ``Matrix`` object ``A``,
and two ``Vector`` objects ``U`` and ``b`` in a
Python program, the purpose is to
set up a solver using the Aztec Conjugate Gradient method from
Trilinos' Aztec library and combine that solver with the
algebraic multigrid preconditioner ML
from the ML library in Trilinos. Since the various parts of
Trilinos are mirrored in Python through the PyTrilinos package,
we can operate directly
on Trilinos-specific objects.

.. code-block:: python

        try:
            from PyTrilinos import Epetra, AztecOO, TriUtils, ML
        except:
            print('''You Need to have PyTrilinos with
        Epetra, AztecOO, TriUtils and ML installed
        for this demo to run''')
            exit()
        
        from dolfin import *
        
        if not has_la_backend('Epetra'):
            print('Warning: Dolfin is not compiled with Trilinos')
            exit()
        
        parameters['linear_algebra_backend'] = 'Epetra'
        
        # create matrix A and vector b in the usual way
        # u is a Function
        
        # Fetch underlying Epetra objects
        A_epetra = down_cast(A).mat()
        b_epetra = down_cast(b).vec()
        U_epetra = down_cast(u.vector()).vec()
        
        # Sets up the parameters for ML using a python dictionary
        ML_param = {"max levels"        : 3,
                    "output"            : 10,
                    "smoother: type"    : "ML symmetric Gauss-Seidel",
                    "aggregation: type" : "Uncoupled",
                    "ML validate parameter list" : False
        }
        
        # Create the preconditioner
        prec = ML.MultiLevelPreconditioner(A_epetra, False)
        prec.SetParameterList(ML_param)
        prec.ComputePreconditioner()
        
        # Create solver and solve system
        solver = AztecOO.AztecOO(A_epetra, U_epetra, b_epetra)
        solver.SetPrecOperator(prec)
        solver.SetAztecOption(AztecOO.AZ_solver, AztecOO.AZ_cg)
        solver.SetAztecOption(AztecOO.AZ_output, 16)
        solver.Iterate(MaxIters=1550, Tolerance=1e-5)
        
        plot(u)

Installing FEniCS
-----------------

.. index:: installing FEniCS

The FEniCS software components are available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS
X platforms. Detailed information on how to get FEniCS running on such
machines are available at the ``fenicsproject.org`` website.
Here are just some quick descriptions and recommendations by the author.

To make the installation of FEniCS as painless and reliable as
possible, I strongly recommend to use Ubuntu Linux.  (Even though Mac
users now can get FEniCS by a one-click install, I recommend using
Ubuntu on Mac, unless you have significant experience with compiling
and linking C++ libraries on Mac OS X.)  Any standard PC can easily be
equipped with Ubuntu Linux, which may live side by side with either
Windows or Mac OS X or another Linux installation.

On Windows you can use the tool `Wubi <http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer>`__ to
automatically install Ubuntu in a dual boot fashion.  A very popular
alternative is to run Ubuntu in a separate window in your existing
operation system, using a *virtual machine*.  There are several
virtual machine solutions to chose among, e.g., the free `VirtualBoxMesh <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`__ or the commercial tool `VMWare Fusion <http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/>`__. VirtualBoxMesh works well for
many, but there might be hardware integration problems on Mac, so the
superior VMWare Fusion tool is often worth the investment.  The author
has a description of `how to install Ubuntu in a VMWare Fusion virtual
machine <http://hplgit.github.io/teamods/ubuntu/vmware/index.html>`__.

Once Ubuntu
is up and running, FEniCS is painlessly installed by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install fenics

Sometimes the FEniCS software in a standard Ubuntu installation
lacks some recent features and bug fixes. Go to
`fenicsproject.org <http://fenicsproject.org>`__, click on *Download*
and then the Ubuntu logo, move down to *Ubuntu PPA* and copy a few Unix
commands to install the newest version of the FEniCS software.

A different type of virtual machine technology is `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com/>`__, which allows you to download a big file
with a complete Ubuntu environment and run that environment in a
terminal window on your Mac or Windows computer. This Ubuntu machine
is integrated with the file system on your computer. The author has
made a Vagrant box with most of the scientific computing
software you need for programming
with FEniCS, see a preliminary `guide <http://hplgit.github.io/INF5620/doc/web/vagrant_inf5620.html>`__
for download, installation, and usage.

The FEniCS installation also features a set of demo programs.
These are stored in locations depending on the type of operating system.
For Ubuntu the programs are stored in ``/usr/share/dolfin/demo``.

The graphical user interface (GUI) of Ubuntu is quite similar to both
Windows and Mac OS X, but to be efficient when doing science with
FEniCS I recommend to run programs in a terminal window and write them
in a text editor like Emacs or Vim. You can employ an integrated
development environment such as Eclipse, but intensive FEniCS
developers and users tend to find terminal windows and plain text
editors more efficient and user friendly.

.. Vagrant!

.. _tut:appendix:books:

Books on the finite element method
----------------------------------

There are a large number of books on the finite element method.  The
books typically fall in either of two categories: the abstract
mathematical version of the method and the engineering "structural
analysis" formulation. FEniCS builds heavily on concepts in the
abstract mathematical exposition. The author has in development
a `book <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/>`__
that explains all details of the finite element method with
the abstract mathematical formulations that FEniCS employ.

An easy-to-read book, which
provides a good general background for using FEniCS, is Gockenbach
[Ref04]_. The book by Donea and Huerta
[Ref05]_ has a similar style, but aims at readers with
interest in fluid flow problems. Hughes [Ref06]_ is also
highly recommended, especially for those interested in solid mechanics
and heat transfer applications.

Readers with background in the engineering "structural analysis"
version of the finite element method may find Bickford
[Ref07]_ as an attractive bridge over to the abstract
mathematical formulation that FEniCS builds upon.  Those who have a
weak background in differential equations in general should consult a
more fundamental book, and Eriksson {\em et
al}. [Ref08]_ is a very good choice.  On the
other hand, FEniCS users with a strong background in mathematics and
interest in the mathematical properties of the finite element method,
will appreciate the texts by Brenner and Scott [Ref09]_,
Braess [Ref10]_, Ern and Guermond [Ref11]_,
Quarteroni and Valli [Ref12]_, or Ciarlet [Ref13]_.

.. _tut:appendix:pybooks:

Books on Python
---------------

Two very popular introductory books on Python are
"Learning Python"  by Lutz [Ref14]_ and
"Practical Python"  by Hetland [Ref15]_.
More advanced and comprehensive books include
"Programming Python" by Lutz [Ref16]_,
and "Python Cookbook" [Ref17]_ and "Python in a Nutshell"
[Ref18]_ by Martelli.
The web page ``http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks``
lists numerous additional books.
Very few texts teach Python in a mathematical and numerical context,
but the references [Ref19]_ [Ref20]_ [Ref21]_
are exceptions.
