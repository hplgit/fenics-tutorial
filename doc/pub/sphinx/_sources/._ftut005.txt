Handling domains with different materials
=========================================

.. index:: heterogeneous media

.. index:: multi-material domain

Solving PDEs in domains made up of different materials is a frequently
encountered task. In FEniCS, these kind of problems are handled by
defining subdomains inside the domain. The subdomains may represent the
various materials. We can thereafter define material properties through
functions, known in FEniCS as *mesh functions*,
that are piecewise constant in each subdomain.
A simple example with
two materials (subdomains) in 2D will
demonstrate the basic steps in the process.

.. Later, a multi-material

.. problem in :math:`d` space dimensions is addressed.

.. _tut:possion:2D:2mat:problem:

Working with two subdomains
---------------------------

Suppose we want to solve

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:2mat:varcoeff2:

.. math::
   :label: tut:poisson:2D:2mat:varcoeff2
         
            \nabla\cdot \left\lbrack k(x,y)\nabla u(x,y)\right\rbrack = 0,
        

in a domain :math:`\Omega` consisting of two subdomains where :math:`k` takes on
a different value in each subdomain.
For simplicity, yet without loss of generality, we choose for the current
implementation
the domain :math:`\Omega = [0,1]\times [0,1]` and divide it into two equal
subdomains,
as depicted in Figure :ref:`tut:possion:2D:2mat:fig1`,

.. math::
        
        \Omega_0 = [0, 1]\times [0,1/2],\quad
        \Omega_1 = [0, 1]\times (1/2,1]{\thinspace .}
        

We define :math:`k(x,y)=k_0` in :math:`\Omega_0` and :math:`k(x,y)=k_1` in :math:`\Omega_1`,
where :math:`k_0>0` and :math:`k_1>0` are given constants.
As boundary conditions, we choose :math:`u=0` at :math:`y=0`, :math:`u=1` at :math:`y=1`,
and :math:`\partial u/\partial n=0` at :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=1`.
One can show that the exact solution is now given by

.. _Eq:_auto40:

.. math::
   :label: _auto40
        
        u(x, y) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        {2yk_1\over k_0+k_1}, & y \leq 1/2\\ 
        {(2y-1)k_0 + k_1\over k_0+k_1}, & y \geq 1/2
        \end{array}\right.
        
        

As long as the element boundaries coincide with the internal boundary
:math:`y=1/2`, this piecewise linear solution should be exactly recovered
by Lagrange elements of any degree. We use this property to verify
the implementation.

Physically, the present problem may correspond to heat conduction, where
the heat conduction in :math:`\Omega_1` is ten times more efficient than
in :math:`\Omega_0`. An alternative interpretation is flow in porous media
with two geological layers, where the layers' ability to transport
the fluid differs by a factor of 10.

.. _tut:possion:2D:2mat:impl:

Implementation          (3)
---------------------------

.. index:: boundary specification (class)

.. index:: mat2_p2D.py

The new functionality in this subsection regards how to define the
subdomains :math:`\Omega_0` and :math:`\Omega_1`. For this purpose we need to use
subclasses of class ``SubDomain``, not only plain functions as we have
used so far for specifying boundaries. Consider the boundary function

.. code-block:: python

        def boundary(x, on_boundary):
            tol = 1E-14
            return on_boundary and abs(x[0]) < tol

for defining the boundary :math:`x=0`. Instead of using such a stand-alone
function, we can create an instance (or object)
of a subclass of ``SubDomain``,
which implements the ``inside`` method as an alternative to the
``boundary`` function:

.. code-block:: python

        class Boundary(SubDomain):
            def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
                tol = 1E-14
                return on_boundary and abs(x[0]) < tol
        
        boundary = Boundary()
        bc = DirichletBC(V, Constant(0), boundary)

A word about computer science terminology may be used here:
The term *instance*
means a Python object of a particular type (such as ``SubDomain``,
``Function``
``FunctionSpace``, etc.).
Many use *instance* and *object*
as interchangeable terms. In other computer programming languages one may
also use the term *variable* for the same thing.
We mostly use the well-known  term *object* in this text.

A subclass of ``SubDomain`` with an ``inside`` method offers
functionality for marking parts of the domain or
the boundary. Now we need to define one class for the
subdomain :math:`\Omega_0`
where :math:`y\leq 1/2` and another for the subdomain :math:`\Omega_1` where :math:`y\geq 1/2`:

.. code-block:: python

        class Omega0(SubDomain):
            def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
                return True if x[1] <= 0.5 else False
        
        class Omega1(SubDomain):
            def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
                return True if x[1] >= 0.5 else False

Notice the use of ``<=`` and ``>=`` in both tests. For a cell to
belong to, e.g., :math:`\Omega_1`, the ``inside`` method must return
``True`` for all the vertices ``x`` of the cell. So to make the
cells at the internal boundary :math:`y=1/2` belong to :math:`\Omega_1`, we need
the test ``x[1] >= 0.5``.

The next task is to use a ``MeshFunction`` to mark all
cells in :math:`\Omega_0` with the subdomain number 0 and all cells in :math:`\Omega_1`
with the subdomain number 1.
Our convention is to number subdomains as :math:`0,1,2,\ldots`.

A ``MeshFunction`` is a discrete function that can be evaluated at a set
of so-called *mesh entities*. Examples of mesh entities are
cells, facets, and vertices. A ``MeshFunction`` over cells is suitable to
represent subdomains (materials), while a ``MeshFunction`` over
facets is used to represent pieces of external or internal boundaries.
Mesh functions over vertices can be used to describe continuous fields.

Since we need to define subdomains of :math:`\Omega`
in the present example, we must make use
of a ``MeshFunction`` over cells. The
``MeshFunction`` constructor is fed with three arguments: 1) the type
of value: ``'int'`` for integers, ``'uint'`` for positive
(unsigned) integers, ``'double'`` for real numbers, and
``'bool'`` for logical values; 2) a ``Mesh`` object, and 3)
the topological dimension of the mesh entity in question: cells
have topological dimension equal to the number of space dimensions in
the PDE problem, and facets have one dimension lower.
Alternatively, the constructor can take just a filename
and initialize the ``MeshFunction`` from data in a file.

We start with creating a ``MeshFunction`` whose
values are non-negative integers (``'uint'``)
for numbering the subdomains.
The mesh entities of interest are the cells, which have dimension 2
in a two-dimensional problem (1 in 1D, 3 in 3D). The appropriate code for
defining the ``MeshFunction`` for two subdomains then reads

.. code-block:: python

        subdomains = MeshFunction('uint', mesh, 2)
        # Mark subdomains with numbers 0 and 1
        subdomain0 = Omega0()
        subdomain0.mark(subdomains, 0)
        subdomain1 = Omega1()
        subdomain1.mark(subdomains, 1)

Calling ``subdomains.array()`` returns a ``numpy`` array of the
subdomain values. That is, ``subdomain.array()[i]`` is
the subdomain value of cell number ``i``. This array is used to
look up the subdomain or material number of a specific element.

We need a function ``k`` that is constant in
each subdomain :math:`\Omega_0` and :math:`\Omega_1`. Since we want ``k``
to be a finite element function, it is natural to choose
a space of functions that are constant over each element.
The family of discontinuous Galerkin methods, in FEniCS
denoted by ``'DG'``, is suitable for this purpose. Since we
want functions that are piecewise constant, the value of
the degree parameter is zero:

.. code-block:: python

        V0 = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'DG', 0)
        k  = Function(V0)

To fill ``k`` with the right values in each element, we loop over
all cells (i.e., indices in ``subdomain.array()``),
extract the corresponding subdomain number of a cell,
and assign the corresponding :math:`k` value to the ``k.vector()`` array:

.. code-block:: python

        k_values = [1.5, 50]  # values of k in the two subdomains
        for cell_no in range(len(subdomains.array())):
            subdomain_no = subdomains.array()[cell_no]
            k.vector()[cell_no] = k_values[subdomain_no]

Long loops in Python are known to be slow, so for large meshes
it is preferable to avoid such loops and instead use *vectorized code*.
Normally this implies that the loop must be replaced by
calls to functions from the ``numpy`` library that operate on complete
arrays (in efficient C code). The functionality we want in the present
case is to compute an array of the same size as
``subdomain.array()``, but where the value ``i`` of an entry
in ``subdomain.array()`` is replaced by ``k_values[i]``.
Such an operation is carried out by the ``numpy`` function ``choose``:

.. code-block:: python

        help = numpy.asarray(subdomains.array(), dtype=numpy.int32)
        k.vector()[:] = numpy.choose(help, k_values)

The ``help`` array is required since ``choose`` cannot work with
``subdomain.array()`` because this array has elements of
type ``uint32``. We must therefore transform this array to an array
``help`` with standard ``int32`` integers.

Having the ``k`` function ready for finite element computations, we
can proceed in the normal manner with defining essential boundary
conditions, as in the section :ref:`tut:poisson:multiple:Dirichlet`,
and the :math:`a(u,v)` and :math:`L(v)` forms, as in
the section :ref:`tut:possion:2D:varcoeff`.
All the details can be found in the file ``mat2_p2D.py``.

.. _tut:poisson:mat:neumann:

Multiple Neumann, Robin, and Dirichlet condition
------------------------------------------------

.. index:: Dirichlet boundary conditions

.. index:: Neumann boundary conditions

.. index:: Robin boundary conditions

.. index:: boundary conditions

Let us go back to the model problem from
the section :ref:`tut:poisson:multiple:Dirichlet`
where we had both Dirichlet and Neumann conditions.
The term ``v*g*ds`` in the expression for ``L`` implies a
boundary integral over the complete boundary, or in FEniCS terms,
an integral over all exterior facets.
However, the contributions from the parts of the boundary where we have
Dirichlet conditions are erased when the linear system is modified by
the Dirichlet conditions.
We would like, from an efficiency point of view, to integrate ``v*g*ds``
only over the parts of the boundary where we actually have Neumann conditions.
And more importantly,
in other problems one may have different Neumann conditions or
other conditions like the Robin type condition.
With the mesh function concept we can mark
different parts of the boundary and integrate over specific parts.
The same concept can also be used to treat multiple Dirichlet conditions.
The forthcoming text illustrates how this is done.

Essentially, we still stick to the model problem from
the section :ref:`tut:poisson:multiple:Dirichlet`, but replace the
Neumann condition at :math:`y=0` by a *Robin condition*:

.. math::
        
        -{\partial u\over\partial n} = p(u-q),
        

where :math:`p` and :math:`q` are specified functions.
The Robin condition is
most often used to model heat transfer to the surroundings and arise
naturally from Newton's cooling law.

Since we have prescribed a simple solution in our model problem,
:math:`u=1+x^2+2y^2`, we adjust :math:`p` and :math:`q` such that the condition holds
at :math:`y=0`. This implies that :math:`q=1+x^2+2y^2` and :math:`p` can be arbitrary
(the normal derivative at :math:`y=0`: :math:`\partial u/\partial n = -\partial u/\partial y = -4y=0`).

Now we have four parts of the boundary: :math:`\Gamma_N` which corresponds to
the upper side :math:`y=1`, :math:`\Gamma_R` which corresponds to the lower part
:math:`y=0`, :math:`\Gamma_0` which corresponds to the left part :math:`x=0`, and
:math:`\Gamma_1` which corresponds to the right part :math:`x=1`. The
complete boundary-value problem reads

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:

.. math::
   :label: tut:poisson:2D:DN3
        
            - \nabla^2 u = -6 \mbox{ in } \Omega, 
        

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:bc1:

.. math::
   :label: tut:poisson:2D:DN3:bc1
          
            u = u_L \mbox{ on } \Gamma_0, 
        

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:bc2:

.. math::
   :label: tut:poisson:2D:DN3:bc2
          
            u = u_R \mbox{ on } \Gamma_1, 
        

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:bc3:

.. math::
   :label: tut:poisson:2D:DN3:bc3
          
            - {\partial u\over\partial n} = p(u-q) \mbox{ on } \Gamma_R,
        
        

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:bc4:

.. math::
   :label: tut:poisson:2D:DN3:bc4
          
            - {\partial u\over\partial n} = g \mbox{ on } \Gamma_N{\thinspace .}
        
        

The involved prescribed functions are :math:`u_L= 1 + 2y^2`,
:math:`u_R = 2 + 2y^2`, :math:`q=1+x^2+2y^2`, :math:`p` is arbitrary, and :math:`g=-4y`.

Integration by parts of :math:`-\int_\Omega v\nabla^2 u {\, \mathrm{d}x}` becomes
as usual

.. math::
        
         -\int_\Omega v\nabla^2 u {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_\Omega\nabla u\cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} - \int_{\partial\Omega}{\partial u\over
        \partial n}v {\, \mathrm{d}s}{\thinspace .}
        

The boundary integral vanishes on :math:`\Gamma_0\cup\Gamma_1`, and
we split the parts over :math:`\Gamma_N` and :math:`\Gamma_R` since we have
different conditions at those parts:

.. math::
        
        - \int_{\partial\Omega}v{\partial u\over\partial n} {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        =
        -\int_{\Gamma_N}v{\partial u\over\partial n} {\, \mathrm{d}s} -
        \int_{\Gamma_R}v{\partial u\over\partial n} {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        = \int_{\Gamma_N}vg {\, \mathrm{d}s} +
        \int_{\Gamma_R}vp(u-q) {\, \mathrm{d}s}{\thinspace .}
        

The weak form then becomes

.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} \nabla u\cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} +
        \int_{\Gamma_N} gv {\, \mathrm{d}s} + \int_{\Gamma_R}p(u-q)v {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        = \int_{\Omega} fv {\, \mathrm{d}x},
        

We want to write this weak form in the standard
notation :math:`a(u,v)=L(v)`, which
requires that we identify all integrals with *both* :math:`u` and :math:`v`,
and collect these in :math:`a(u,v)`, while the remaining integrals with
:math:`v` and not :math:`u` go
into :math:`L(v)`.
The integral from the Robin condition must of this reason be split in two
parts:

.. math::
         \int_{\Gamma_R}p(u-q)v {\, \mathrm{d}s}
        = \int_{\Gamma_R}puv {\, \mathrm{d}s} - \int_{\Gamma_R}pqv {\, \mathrm{d}s}{\thinspace .}
        

We then have

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:var:a:

.. math::
   :label: tut:poisson:2D:DN3:var:a
        
        a(u, v) = \int_{\Omega} \nabla u\cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        + \int_{\Gamma_R}puv {\, \mathrm{d}s},
        
        

.. _Eq:tut:poisson:2D:DN3:var:L:

.. math::
   :label: tut:poisson:2D:DN3:var:L
          
        L(v) = \int_{\Omega} fv {\, \mathrm{d}x} -
        \int_{\Gamma_N} g v {\, \mathrm{d}s} + \int_{\Gamma_R}pqv {\, \mathrm{d}s}{\thinspace .}
        
        

.. index:: dnr_p2D.py

A natural starting point for implementation is the ``dn2_p2D.py``
program in the directory ``stationary/poisson``. The new aspects are

 1. definition of a mesh function over the boundary,

 2. marking each side as a subdomain, using the mesh function,

 3. splitting a boundary integral into parts.

Task 1 makes use of the ``MeshFunction`` object, but contrary to
the section :ref:`tut:possion:2D:2mat:impl`, this is not a function over
cells, but a function over cell facets. The topological dimension of
cell facets is one lower than the cell interiors, so in a two-dimensional
problem the dimension
becomes 1. In general, the facet dimension
is given as ``mesh.topology().dim()-1``,
which we use in the code for ease of direct reuse in other problems.
The construction of a ``MeshFunction`` object to mark boundary parts
now reads

.. code-block:: python

        boundary_parts = \ 
          MeshFunction('size_t', mesh, mesh.topology().dim()-1)

As in the section :ref:`tut:possion:2D:2mat:impl` we
use a subclass of ``SubDomain`` to identify the various parts
of the mesh function. Problems with domains of more complicated geometries may
set the mesh function for marking boundaries as part of the mesh
generation.
In our case, the :math:`y=0` boundary can be marked by

.. code-block:: python

        class LowerRobinBoundary(SubDomain):
            def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
                tol = 1E-14   # tolerance for coordinate comparisons
                return on_boundary and abs(x[1]) < tol
        
        Gamma_R = LowerRobinBoundary()
        Gamma_R.mark(boundary_parts, 0)

The code for the :math:`y=1` boundary is similar and is seen in
``dnr_p2D.py``.

The Dirichlet boundaries are marked similarly, using subdomain number 2 for :math:`\Gamma_0` and 3 for :math:`\Gamma_1`:

.. code-block:: python

        class LeftBoundary(SubDomain):
            def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
                tol = 1E-14   # tolerance for coordinate comparisons
                return on_boundary and abs(x[0]) < tol
        
        Gamma_0 = LeftBoundary()
        Gamma_0.mark(boundary_parts, 2)
        
        class RightBoundary(SubDomain):
            def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
                tol = 1E-14   # tolerance for coordinate comparisons
                return on_boundary and abs(x[0] - 1) < tol
        
        Gamma_1 = RightBoundary()
        Gamma_1.mark(boundary_parts, 3)

Specifying the ``DirichletBC`` objects may now make use of
the mesh function (instead of a ``SubDomain`` subclass object)
and an indicator for which subdomain each condition
should be applied to:

.. code-block:: python

        u_L = Expression('1 + 2*x[1]*x[1]')
        u_R = Expression('2 + 2*x[1]*x[1]')
        bcs = [DirichletBC(V, u_L, boundary_parts, 2),
               DirichletBC(V, u_R, boundary_parts, 3)]

Some functions need to be defined before we can go on with the
``a`` and ``L`` of the variational problem:

.. code-block:: python

        g = Expression('-4*x[1]')
        q = Expression('1 + x[0]*x[0] + 2*x[1]*x[1]')
        p = Constant(100)  # arbitrary function can go here
        u = TrialFunction(V)
        v = TestFunction(V)
        f = Constant(-6.0)

The new aspect of the variational problem is the two distinct
boundary integrals.
Having a mesh function over exterior cell facets (our
``boundary_parts`` object), where subdomains (boundary parts) are
numbered as :math:`0,1,2,\ldots`, the special symbol ``ds(0)``
implies integration over subdomain (part) 0, ``ds(1)`` denotes
integration over subdomain (part) 1, and so on.
The idea of multiple ``ds``-type objects generalizes to volume
integrals too: ``dx(0)``, ``dx(1)``, etc., are used to
integrate over subdomain 0, 1, etc.,  inside :math:`\Omega`.

The variational problem can be defined as

.. code-block:: python

        a = inner(nabla_grad(u), nabla_grad(v))*dx + p*u*v*ds(0)
        L = f*v*dx - g*v*ds(1) + p*q*v*ds(0)

For the ``ds(0)`` and ``ds(1)`` symbols to work we must obviously
connect them (or ``a`` and ``L``) to the mesh function marking
parts of the boundary. This is done by a certain keyword argument
to the ``assemble`` function:


.. warning::
    The old code looked like
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
            A = assemble(a, exterior_facet_domains=boundary_parts)
            b = assemble(L, exterior_facet_domains=boundary_parts)
    
    but the ``exterior_facet_domain`` argument is no longer legal.
    The text must be updated! The associated code gives wrong results.




.. code-block:: python

        A = assemble(a)
        b = assemble(L)

Then essential boundary conditions are enforced, and the system can
be solved in the usual way:

.. code-block:: python

        for bc in bcs:
            bc.apply(A, b)
        u = Function(V)
        U = u.vector()
        solve(A, U, b)

The complete code is in the ``dnr_p2D.py`` file in the
``stationary/poisson`` directory.
