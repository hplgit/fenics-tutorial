======= Deflection of a membrane =======
label{ch:poisson0:membrane}

The previous problem and code targeted a simple test problem where we
can easily verify the implementation. Now we turn the attention to
a more physically relevant problem, in a non-trivial geometry, and
that results in solutions of somewhat more exciting shape.

We want to compute the deflection $D(x,y)$ of a two-dimensional,
circular membrane, subject to a load $p$ over the membrane. The
appropriate PDE model is

!bt
\begin{equation}
-T\nabla^2 D = p(x,y)\quad\hbox{in }\Omega = \{ (x,y)\,\vert\, x^2+y^2\leq R\}\tp
\end{equation}
!et
Here, $T$ is the tension in the membrane (constant), and $p$ is the external
pressure load.
The boundary of the membrane has no
deflection, implying $D=0$ as boundary condition.
A localized load can be modeled as a Gaussian function:

!bt
\begin{equation}
p(x,y) = {A\over 2\pi\sigma}\exp{\left(
- {1\over2}\left( {x-x_0\over\sigma}\right)^2
- {1\over2}\left( {y-y_0\over\sigma}\right)^2
\right)}\, .
\end{equation}
!et
The parameter $A$ is the amplitude of the pressure,
$(x_0,y_0)$ the localization of the maximum point of the load,
and $\sigma$ the ``width'' of $p$.

===== Scaling =====

The localization of the pressure, $(x_0,y_0)$, is for simplicity
set to $(0, R_0)$.
There are many physical parameters in this problem, and we can benefit
from grouping them by means of scaling. Let us introduce dimensionless
coordinates $\bar x = x/R$, $\bar y = y/R$, and a dimensionless
deflection $w=D/D_c$, where $D_c$ is a characteristic size of the
deflection. Introducing $\bar R_0=R_0/R$, we get

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial\bar x^2} +
\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial\bar y^2}= \alpha
\exp{\left(
- \beta^2(\bar x^2
+ (\bar y-\bar R_0)^2)\right)}\hbox{ for } \bar x^2 + \bar y^2 < 1,\]
!et
where

!bt
\[ \alpha = \frac{R^2A}{2\pi T D_c\sigma},\quad\beta = \frac{R}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\tp\]
!et
With an appropriate scaling, $\bar w$ and its derivatives are of size
unity, so the left-hand side of the scaled PDE is about unity in size,
while the right-hand side has $\alpha$ as its characteristic size.
This suggest choosing $\alpha$ to be unity, or around unit.  We shall
in particular choose $\alpha=4$. With this value, the solution is
$w(\bar x,\bar y) = 1-\bar x^2 - \bar y^2$.  (One can also find the
analytical solution in scaled coordinates and show that the maximum
deflection $D(0,0)$ is $D_c$ if we choose $\alpha=4$ to determine
$D_c$.)  With $D_c=AR^2/(8\pi\sigma T)$ and dropping the bars we get
the scaled problem

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2w = 4\exp{\left(
- \beta^2(x^2
+ (y-R_0)^2)\right)},
label{ch:poisson0:membrane:scaled:eq}
\end{equation}
!et
to be solved over the unit circle with $w=0$ on the boundary.  Now
there are only two parameters to vary: the dimensionless extent of the
pressure, $\beta$, and the localization of the pressure peak, $R_0\in
[0,1]$.  As $\beta\rightarrow 0$, we have a special case with solution
$w=1-x^2-y^2$.

Given a computed $w$, the physical deflection is given by

!bt
\[ D = \frac{AR^2}{8\pi\sigma T}w\tp\]
!et

Just a few modifications are necessary in our previous program to solve
this new problem.

===== Defining the mesh =====

A mesh over the unit circle can be created by the `mshr` tool in
FEniCS:

!bc pyhid
from fenics import *
!ec

!bc pycod
from mshr import *
domain = Circle(Point(0.0, 0.0), 1.0)
n = 20
mesh = generate_mesh(domain, n)
% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
plot(mesh, interactive=True)
% endif
!ec
The `Circle` shape from `mshr` takes the center and radius of the circle
as the two first arguments, while `n` is the resolution, here the
suggested number of cells per radius.

===== Defining the load =====

idx{`Expresion`}
idx{Expression with parameters}

The right-hand side pressure function
is represented by an `Expression` object. There
are two physical parameters in the formula for $f$ that enter the
expression string and these parameters must have their values set
by keyword arguments:

!bc pycod
beta = 8
R0 = 0.6
p = Expression(
    '4*exp(-pow(beta,2)*(pow(x[0], 2) + pow(x[1]-R0, 2)))',
    beta=beta, R0=R0)
!ec
The coordinates in `Expression` objects *must* be a vector
with indices 0, 1, and 2, and with the name `x`. Otherwise
we are free to introduce names of parameters as long as these are
given default values by keyword arguments. All the parameters
initialized by keyword arguments can at any time have their
values modified. For example, we may set

!bc pycod-t
p.beta = 12
p.R0 = 0.3
!ec

% if FORMAT == 'ipynb':
We also need to define a function space and boundary conditions:

!bc pyhid
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 2)

def u0_boundary(x, on_boundary):
    return on_boundary

u0 = Constant(0)
bc = DirichletBC(V, u0, u0_boundary)
!ec
% endif

idx{interpolation}

===== Variational form =====

We may introduce `w` instead of `u` as primary unknown and `p` instead
of `f` as right-hand side function:

!bc pycod
w = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
a = dot(grad(w), grad(v))*dx
L = p*v*dx

w = Function(V)
solve(a == L, w, bc)
!ec

% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
# Avoid plot command in notebook. It easily makes the kernel freeze.

===== Visualization =====

It would be of interest to visualize $p$ along with $w$ so that we can
examine the pressure force and the membrane's response.  We must then
transform the formula (`Expression`) to a finite element function
(`Function`).  The most natural approach is to construct a finite
element function whose degrees of freedom are calculated from
$p$. That is, we interpolate $p$:

!bc pycod
p = interpolate(p, V)
!ec
Note that the assignment to `p` destroys the previous `Expression`
object `p`, so if it is of interest to still have access to this
object, another name must be used for the `Function` object returned
by `interpolate`.

We can now plot `w` and `p` on the screen
as well as dump the fields to file in VTK format:

!bc pycod
plot(w, title='Deflection')
plot(p, title='Load')

vtkfile1 = File('membrane_deflection.pvd')
vtkfile1 << w
vtkfile2 = File('membrane_load.pvd')
vtkfile2 << p
!ec
Figure ref{ch:poisson0:membrane:fig} shows the result of the `plot` commands.

% endif

===== Curve plots through the domain =====

# Nice with some matplotlib plots in notebooks...and very useful for
# scientific investigations.

The best way to compare the load and the deflection is to make a curve plot
along the line $x=0$. This is just a matter of defining a set of points
along the line and evaluating the finite element functions `w` and `p`
at these points:

@@@CODE src/membrane.py fromto: # Curve plot@plt\.savefig
% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
(Remember a `plt.show()` at the end to show the plot on the screen.)
The resulting curve plot appears in Figure ref{ch:poisson0:membrane:fig2}.
It is seen how the localized input ($p$) is heavily damped and smoothened in
the output ($w$). This reflects a typical property of the Poisson equation.

The complete program is available in the file
"`${prog["membrane"]}.py`": "${src_url}/${prog['membrane']}.py".

===== Running ParaView =====
label{ftut:paraview}

"ParaView": "http://www.paraview.org" is a very strong and well-developed
tool for visualizing scalar and vector fields, including those
computed by FEniCS.

Our program file writes $w$ and $p$ to file as finite element
functions.  The default filenames are `membrane_deflection.pvd` for
$w$ and `membrane_load.vtu` for $p$.  These files are in VTK format
and their data can be visualized in ParaView.

 o Start the ParaView application.
 o Open a file with _File - Open..._. You will see a list of `.pvd` and
   `.vtu` files. More specifically you see `membrane_deflection.pvd`.
   Choose this file.
 o Click on _Apply_ to the left (*Properties* pane) in the GUI, and
   ParaView will visualize the contents of the file, here as a color image.
 o To get rid of the axis in the lower left corner of the plot area
   and axis cross in the middle of the circle, find the *Show Orientation Axis* and *Show Center* buttons to the right in the second row of buttons at the top of the GUI. Click on these buttons to toggle axis information on/off.
 o If you want a color bar to explain the mapping between $w$ values and colors,
   go to the *Color Map Editor* in the right of the GUI and use the
   *Show/hide color legend* button. Alternatively, find *Coloring* in the
   lower left part of the GUI, and toggle the *Show* button.
 o The color map, by default going from blue (low values) to red (high values),
   can easily be changed. Find the *Coloring* menu in the left part of the
   GUI, click *Edit*, then in the *Color Map Editor* double click at the
   left end of the color spectrum and choose another color, say yellow, then
   double click at the right and of the spectrum and choose pink, scroll
   down to the bottom of the dialog and click *Update*. The color map now
   goes from yellow to pink.
 o To save the plot to file, click on _File - Export Scene..._,
   fill in a filename, and save.
   See Figure ref{ftut:paraview:figwp} (middle).
 o To change the background color of plots, choose
   _Edit - Settings..._, _Color_ tab, click on _Background Color_,
   and choose it to be, e.g., white. Then choose _Foreground Color_ to
   be something different.
 o To plot the mesh with colors reflecting the size of $w$, find the
   *Representation* drop down menu in the left part of the GUI, and replace
   *Surface* by *Wireframe*.
 o To overlay a surface plot with a wireframe plot, load $w$ and plot
   as surface, then load $w$ again and plot as wireframe. Make sure
   both icons in the *Pipeline Browser* in the left part of the GUI
   are *on* for the `membrane_deflection.pvd` files you want to display.
   See Figure ref{ftut:paraview:figwp} (left).
 o Redo the surface plot. Then we can add some contour lines.
   Press the semi-sphere icon in the third row of buttons at the top of the
   GUI (the so-called *filters*). A set of contour values can now be
   specified at in a dialog box in the left part of the GUI. Remove
   the default contour (0.578808) and add 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05.
   Click *Apply* and see an overlay of white contour lines.
   In the *Pipeline Browser* you can click on the icons to turn
   a filter on or off.
 o Divide the plot window into two, say horizontally, using the top right
   small icon. Choose the _3D View_ button. Open a new file and load
   `memberane_load.pvd`. Click on _Apply_ to see a plot of the load.
 o To plot a 2D scalar field as a surface, load the field,
   click _Apply_ to plot it, then select
   from the _Filters_ pulldown menu the filter *Wrap By Scalar*, click
   _Apply_, then toggle the _2D_ button to _3D_ in the Layout `#1`
   window (upper row of buttons in that window). Now you can rotate
   the figure. The height of the surface is very low, so go to the
   *Properties (Warp By Scalar1)* window to the left in the GUI and give
   a *Scale Factor* of 20 and re-click _Apply_. Figure ref{ftut:paraview:figwp}
   (right) shows the result.
   to lift the surface by a factor of 20.

A particularly useful feature of ParaView is that you can record GUI clicks
(_Tools - Start/Stop Trace_) and
get them translated to Python code. This allows you automate the
visualization process. You can also make curve plots along lines through
the domain, etc.

===== Using the built-in visualization tool =====
label{ftut:quickviz}
idx{visualization} idx{plotting} idx{VTK}

This section explains some useful visualization features of the
built-in visualization tool in FEniCS.  The `plot` command applies the
VTK package to visualize finite element functions in a very quick and
simple way.  The command is ideal for debugging, teaching, and initial
scientific investigations.  The visualization can be interactive, or
you can steer and automate it through program statements.  More
advanced and professional visualizations are usually better created
with advanced tools like Mayavi, ParaView, or VisIt.

idx{`plot`}

The `plot` function can take additional arguments, such as
a title of the plot, or a specification of a wireframe plot (elevated mesh)
instead of a colored surface plot:

!bc pycod
plot(mesh, title='Finite element mesh')
plot(w, wireframe=True, title='Solution')
!ec
Axes can be turned on by the `axes=True` argument, while
`interactive=True` makes the program hang at the plot command - you have
to type `q` in the plot window to terminate the plot and continue execution.

The left mouse button is used to rotate the surface, while the right
button can zoom the image in and out.  Point the mouse to the `Help`
text down in the lower left corner to get a list of all the keyboard
commands that are available.

The plots created by pressing `p` or `P` are stored in filenames
having the form `dolfin_plot_X.png` or `dolfin_plot_X.pdf`, where `X`
is an integer that is increased by one from the last plot that was
made. The file stem `dolfin_plot_` can be set to something more
suitable through the `hardcopy_prefix` keyword argument to the `plot`
function, for instance, `plot(f, hardcopy_prefix='pressure')`.

idx{rotate PDF plots}
idx{`pdftk`}

Plots stored in PDF format need to be rotated 90 degrees before
inclusion in documents. This can be done by the `convert -rotate 90`
command (from the ImageMagick utility), but the resulting file has
then no more high-resolution PDF vector graphics. A better solution
is therefore to use `pdftk` to preserve the vector graphics:

!bc sys
Terminal> pdftk dolfin_plot_1.pdf cat 1-endnorth output out.pdf
!ec

For making plots in batch, we can do the following:

!bc pycod
viz_w = plot(w, interactive=False)
viz_w.elevate(-10)  # adjust (lift) camera from the default view
viz_w.plot(w)       # bring new settings into action
viz_w.write_png('deflection')  # make deflection.png
viz_w.write_pdf('deflection')  # make deflection.pdf
# Rotate pdf file (right) from landscape to portrait
import os
os.system('pdftk deflection.pdf cat 1-endnorth output w.pdf')
!ec

The ranges of the color scale can be set by the `range_min` and `range_max`
keyword arguments to `plot`. The values must be `float` objects. These
arguments are important to keep fixed for animations in time-dependent
problems.

===== Exercise: Visualize a solution in a cube =====
file=poissin_3d_func

[hpl: The solution refers to a solver *function*. This is not introduced
before later, so present both a flat program and a solver function (as
a teaser).]

Solve the problem $-\nabla^2 u = f$ on the unit cube $[0,1]\times[0,1]\times
[0,1]$ with $u_0 = 1 + x^2 + 2y^2 - 4z^2$ on the boundary.
Visualize the solution. Explore both the built-in visualization tool and
ParaView.

!bsol
As hinted by the filename in this exercise,
a good starting point is the `solver` function in
the program `${prog["poisson_func"]}.py`, which solves the corresponding 2D
problem. Only two lines in the body of `solver` needs to be changed (!):
`mesh = ...`. Replace this line with

!bc pycod
mesh = UnitCubeMesh(Nx, Ny, Nz)
!ec
and add `Nz` as argument to `solver`. We implement the new $u_0$ function
in `application_test` and realize that the proper $f(x,y,z)$ function
in this new case is 2.

!bc pycod
u0 = Expression('1 + x[0]*x[0] + 2*x[1]*x[1] - 4*x[2]*x[2]')
f = Constant(2.0)
u = solver(f, u0, 6, 4, 3, 1)
!ec
The numerical solution is without approximation errors so we can
reuse the unit test from 2D, but it needs an extra `Nz` parameter.

The variation in $u$ is only quadratic so a coarse mesh is okay for
visualization. Below is plot from the ParaView (left) and the built-in
visualization tool (right).  The usage is as in 2D, but now one can
use the mouse to rotate the 3D cube.

We can in ParaView add a contour filter and define contour surfaces for
$u=-2,1,0,1,2,3$, then add a slice filter to get a slice with colors:
