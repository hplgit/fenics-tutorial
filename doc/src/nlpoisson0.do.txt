======= A nonlinear Poisson equation =======
label{ftut1:gallery:nonlinearpoisson}

We shall now address how to solve nonlinear PDEs. We will see that
nonlinear problems can be solved just as easily as linear problems in
FEniCS, by simply defining a nonlinear variational problem and calling
the `solve` function. When doing so, we will encounter a subtle
difference in how the variational problem is defined.

===== PDE problem =====

As a sample PDE for the implementation of nonlinear problems, we
take the following nonlinear Poisson equation:

!bt
\begin{equation}
-\nabla\cdot\left( q(u)\nabla u\right) = f,
\end{equation}
!et
in $\Omega$, with $u=\ub$ on the boundary $\partial\Omega$.
The coefficient $q(u)$ makes the equation nonlinear (unless $q(u)$
is constant in $u$).

===== Variational formulation =====

As usual, we multiply our PDE by a test function $v\in\hat V$,
integrate over the domain, and integrate the second-order derivatives
by parts.  The boundary integral arising from integration by parts
vanishes wherever we employ Dirichlet conditions.  The resulting
variational formulation of our model problem becomes: find $u \in V$
such that

!bt
\begin{equation}
F(u; v) = 0 \quad \forall v \in \hat{V},
label{ch:poisson0:nonlinear1}
\end{equation}
!et
where

!bt
\begin{equation}
F(u; v) = \int_\Omega q(u)\nabla u\cdot \nabla v + fv \dx,
label{ch:poisson0:nonlinear2}
\end{equation}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{align*}
     V      &= \{v \in H^1(\Omega) : v = \ub \mbox{ on } \partial\Omega\},\\
    \hat{V} &= \{v \in H^1(\Omega) : v = 0 \mbox{ on } \partial\Omega\}\tp
\end{align*}
!et

The discrete problem arises as usual by restricting $V$ and $\hat V$
to a pair of discrete spaces. As before, we omit any subscript on
the discrete spaces and discrete solution.
The discrete nonlinear problem is then written as: find $u\in V$ such that

!bt
\begin{equation}
  F(u; v) = 0 \quad \forall v \in \hat{V},
label{ch:poisson0:nonlinear:d}
\end{equation}
!et
with $u = \sum_{j=1}^N U_j \phi_j$. Since $F$ is a nonlinear function
of $u$, the variational statement gives rise to a system of
nonlinear algebraic equations in the unknowns $U_1,\ldots,U_N$.

=== Test problem ===

To solve a test problem, we need to choose the right-hand side $f$,
the coefficient $q(u)$ and the boundary value $\ub$.  Previously, we
have worked with manufactured solutions that can be reproduced without
approximation errors. This is more difficult in nonlinear problems,
and the algebra is more tedious. However, we may utilize SymPy for
symbolic computing and integrate such computations in the FEniCS
solver. This allows us to easily experiment with different
manufactured solutions. The forthcoming code with SymPy requires some
basic familiarity with this package. In particular, we will use the
SymPy functions `diff` for symbolic differentiation and `ccode` for
C/C++ code generation.

We try out a two-dimensional manufactured
solution that is linear in the unknowns:

@@@CODE src/nlpoisson.py fromto: from fenics import *@u_code =

!bnotice Define symbolic coordinates as required in `Expression` objects
Note that we would normally write `x, y = sym.symbols('x y')`, but
if we want the resulting expressions to have valid syntax for
FEniCS `Expression` objects, we must use `x[0]` and `x[1]`.
This is easily accomplished with `sympy` by defining the names of `x` and
`y` as `x[0]` and `x[1]`: `x, y = sym.symbols('x[0] x[1]')`.
!enotice

Turning the expressions for `u` and `f` into C or C++ syntax for
FEniCS `Expression` objects needs two steps. First, we ask for the C
code of the expressions:

!bc pycod
u_code = sym.printing.ccode(u)
f_code = sym.printing.ccode(f)
!ec
Sometimes, we need some editing of the result to match the required
syntax of `Expression` objects, but not in this case. (The primary
example is that `M_PI` for $\pi$ in C/C++ must be replaced by `pi` for
`Expression` objects.) In our case here, the output of `c_code` and
`f_code` is

!bc ccod-t
x[0] + 2*x[1] + 1
-10*x[0] - 20*x[1] - 10
!ec
After having defined the mesh, the function space, and the boundary,
we define the boundary value `u_b` as

!bc pycod
u_b = Expression(u_code)
!ec
Similarly, we define the right-hand side function as

!bc pycod
f = Expression(f_code)
!ec
% if FORMAT == 'ipynb':

Here is the complete code to be executed and experimented with:

@@@CODE src/nlpoisson.py fromto: from __future__ import print@print\('error

We can examine the solution at the vertices:

!bc pycod
u0_at_vertices = u0_Function.compute_vertex_values()
u_at_vertices = u.compute_vertex_values()
coor = V.mesh().coordinates()
for i, x in enumerate(coor):
    print('vertex %2d (%9g,%9g): error=%g' %
          (i, x[0], x[1],
           u0_at_vertices[i] - u_at_vertices[i]))
!ec
% endif

!bwarning Name clash between `fenics` and program variables
In a program like the one above, strange errors may occur due to
name clashes. If you define `sym` and `q` prior to doing
`from fenics import *`, the latter statement will also import
variables with the names `sym` and `q`, overwriting
the objects you have previously defined! This may lead to strange
errors. The safest solution is to do `import fenics as fe`
and then prefix all FEniCS
object names by `fe`. The next best solution is to do
`from fenics import *` first and then define your own variables
that overwrite those imported from `fenics`. This is acceptable
if we do not need `sym` and `q` from `fenics`.

=== FEniCS implementation ===

A working solver for the nonlinear Poisson equation is as easy to
implement as a solver for the corresponding linear problem.
All we need to do is to state the formula for $F$ and call
`solve(F == 0, u, bc)` instead of `solve(a == L, u, bc)` as we did
in the linear case. Here is a minimalistic code:

!bc pycod
from fenics import *

def q(u):
    """Nonlinear coefficient in the PDE."""
    return 1 + u**2

mesh = UnitSquareMesh(32, 32)
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 1)
u_b = Expression(...)

def boundary(x, on_boundary):
    return on_boundary

bc = DirichletBC(V, u_b, boundary)

# Define variational problem
u = Function(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
f = Expression(...)
F = q(u)*dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx - f*v*dx

# Compute solution
solve(F == 0, u, bc)
!ec
The major difference from a linear problem is that the unknown function
`u` in the variational form in the nonlinear case
must be defined as a `Function`, not a `TrialFunction`. In some sense
this is a simplification from the linear case where we must define `u`
first as a `TrialFunction` and then as a `Function`.

The `solve` function takes the nonlinear equations, derives symbolically
the Jacobian matrix, and runs a Newton method to compute the solution.

[AL: Should we display all codes like this one?]
[hpl: Now experimenting with refernce to repo and in html and sphinx
a button will fold out the code.]

The complete code is found in the file
"`${prog["nlpoisson"]}.py`": "${src_url}/${prog['nlpoisson']}.py".

% if FORMAT in ('html', 'sphinx'):
@@@CODE src/nlpoisson.py envir=pypro
% endif

Running the code gives output that tells how the Newton iteration
progresses. With $2(6\times 4)$ cells we get convergence in 7
iterations with a tolerance of $10^{-9}$, and the error in the
numerical solution is about $10^{-11}$. With $2(3\times 3)$ and
$2(8\times 8)$ cells the error is identically zero.  Other resolutions
may bring the error up to the level of the tolerance in the Newton
iterations. These results bring evidence for a correct implementation.
Thinking in terms of finite differences on a uniform mesh, P1 elements
mimics standard second-order differences, which compute the derivative
of a linear function exactly, also a quadratic function. Here, $\nabla
u$ is a constant vector, but then multiplied by $(1+u^2)$, which is a
second-order polynomial in $x$ and $y$, which the divergence
``difference operator'' should compute exactly.  We can therefore,
even with P1 elements, expect the manufactured $u$ to be reproduced by
our method. With a nonlinearity like $1+u^4$, this will not be the
case, and we would need to verify convergence rates instead.

The current example shows how easy it is to solve a nonlinear problem
in FEniCS. However, experts on the numerical solution of nonlinear PDEs
know very well that automated procedures may fail in nonlinear
problems, and that it is often necessary to have much better manual
control of the solution process than what we have in the current
case. Therefore, we return to this problem in Chapter
ref{ftut:nonlinear} in cite{ftut2} and show how we can implement our
own solution algorithms for nonlinear equations and also how we can
steer the parameters in the automated Newton method used above. You
will then see how easy it is to implement tailored solution
strategies for nonlinear problems in FEniCS.
