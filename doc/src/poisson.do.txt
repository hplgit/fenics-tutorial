======= Refactoring the Poisson solver =======
label{ch:poisson0:impl2}

All programs created in this book so far are ``flat''; that is, they are
not organized into logical, reusable units in terms of Python
functions. Such flat programs are useful for quickly testing out some
software, but not well suited for serious problem solving. We shall
therefore look at how to *refactor* the Poisson solver from Chapter
ref{ch:fundamentals}.  For a start, this means splitting the code into
functions, but this is just a reordering of the existing
statements. During refactoring, we also try make the functions we
create as reusable as possible in other contexts. We will also
encapsulate statements specific to a certain problem into
(non-reusable) functions. Being able to distinguish reusable code from
specialized code is a key issue when refactoring code, and this
ability depends on a good mathematical understanding of the problem at
hand (what is general, what is special?).  In a flat program,
general and specialized code (and mathematics) are often mixed
together.

===== A more general solver function =====
label{ch:poisson0:impl2:func}

We consider the flat program developed in ref[Section
ref{ch:poisson0:impl}][ in cite{ftut1}][the section "FEniCS
implementation": "" in cite{ftut1}].  Some of the code in this program
is needed to solve any Poisson problem $-\nabla^2 u=f$ on $[0,1]\times
[0,1]$ with $u=\ub$ on the boundary, while other statements arise from
our simple test problem. Let us collect the general, reusable code in
a function called `solver`. Our special test problem will then just be
an application of `solver` with some additional statements. We limit
the `solver` function to just *compute the numerical
solution*. Plotting and comparing the solution with the exact solution
are considered to be problem-specific activities to be performed
elsewhere.

We parameterize `solver` by $f$, $\ub$, and the resolution of the
mesh. Since it is so trivial to use higher-order finite element
functions by changing the third argument to `FunctionSpace`, we let
also the polynomial degree of the finite element function space
be an argument to `solver`.

@@@CODE src/poisson_func.py fromto: from fenics import@def test_solver

The remaining tasks of our initial program, such calling the `solve`
function with problem-specific parameters and plotting,
can be placed in a separate function. Here we choose to put this code
in a function named `application_test`:

@@@CODE src/poisson_func.py fromto: def application_test@if __name

The solution can now be computed, plotted, and saved to file by
simply calling the `application_test` function.

===== Writing the solver as a Python module =====

The refactored code is put in a file "`${prog['poisson_func']}.py`":
"${src_url}/poisson/${prog['poisson_func']}.py". We should make sure
that such a file can be imported (and hence reused) in other programs.
Then all statements in the main program that are not inside functions
should appear within a test `if __name__ == '__main__':`. This test is
true if the file is executed as a program, but false if the file is
imported.  If we want to run this file in the same way as we can run
`${prog['poisson_func']}.py`, the main program is simply a call to
`application_test()` followed by a call `interactive()` to hold the
plot:

@@@CODE src/poisson_func.py fromto: if __name@

idx{unit testing}

===== Verification and unit tests =====

The remaining part of our first program is to compare the numerical
and the exact solutions. Every time we edit the code we must rerun the
test and examine that `max_error` is sufficiently small so we know
that the code still works. To this end, we shall adopt *unit testing*,
meaning that we create a mathematical test and corresponding software
that can run all our tests automatically and check that all tests
pass.  Python has several tools for unit testing. Two very popular
ones are `pytest` and `nose`. These are almost identical and very easy
to use.  More classical unit testing with test classes is offered by
the built-in tool `unittest`, but here we are going to use `pytest`
(or `nose`) since that will result in shorter and clearer code.

Mathematically, our unit test is that the finite element solution of
our problem when $f=-6$ equals the exact solution $u=\ub=1+x^2+2y^2$.
We have already created code that finds the maximum error in the
numerical solution. Because of rounding errors, we cannot demand this
maximum error to be zero, but we have to use a tolerance, which
depends to the number of elements and the degrees of the polynomials
in the finite element basis functions.  If we want to test that the
`solver` function works for meshes up to $2\times(20\times 20)$
elements and cubic Lagrange elements, $10^{-11}$ is an appropriate
tolerance for testing that the maximum error vanishes (see ref[Section
ref{ch:poisson0:impl:dissect}][ in cite{ftut1}][the section
"Dissection of the program": "" in cite{ftut1}]).

[AL: Changed to `pytest` and `nose` here (in computer font). Change
back if not appropriate.]
[hpl: Changed back as pytest and nose are standard phrasings on the net.]

Only three statements are necessary to carry out the unit
test. However, we shall embed these statements a special way in our
code so that they are recognized by `pytest` and `nose`. The simple
rule is that each test must be placed in a function that

 * has a name starting with `test_`,
 * has no arguments,
 * implements a test expressed as `assert success, msg`.

Regarding the last point, `success` is a boolean expression that is
`False` if the test fails, and in that case the string `msg` is
written to the screen. When the test fails, `assert` raises an
`AssertionError` exception in Python, otherwise the statement runs
silently. The `msg` string is optional, so `assert success` is the
minimal test. In our case, we will write `assert max_error < tol`,
where `tol` is the tolerance ($10^{-11}$) mentioned above.

A proper *test function* for implementing this unit test in the
`pytest` or `nose` testing frameworks has the following form. Note
that we perform the test for different mesh resolutions and degrees of
finite elements.

@@@CODE src/poisson_func.py fromto: def test_solver@def application_test
To run the test, we type the following command:

!bc sys
Terminal> py.test -s -v ${prog['poisson_func']}.py
!ec
This will run all functions `test_*()` (currently only the
`test_solver` function) found in the file and report the results.

We shall make it a habit in the following test to encapsulate numerical test
problems in unit tests as done above, and we strongly encourage the
reader to create similar unit tests whenever a FEniCS solver is
implemented.

#We dare to assert that this is the only serious way
#do reliable computational science with FEniCS.

!bnotice Tip: Print messages in test functions
The `assert` statement runs silently when the test passes so users may
become uncertain if all the statements in a test function are really
executed. A psychological help is to print out something before `assert`
(as we do in the example above) such that it is clear that the
test really takes place.
Note that `py.test` needs the `-s` option to show printout
from the test functions.

===== Examining the degrees of freedom =====
label{ch:poisson0:verify1}

[AL: Important section, but maybe it fits better somewhere else since
it does not specifically deal with code structuring.]
[hpl: Agree, it has been moved around...and it is pretty basic and should
appear early (not volume II).]

We have seen how to grab the degrees of freedom array from a
finite element function `u`:

!bc pycod
dofs = u.vector().array()
!ec

For a finite function from a standard continuous piecewise linear
function space ($\mathsf{P}_1$ Lagrange elements), these values will
be the same as the values we get by the following statement:

!bc pycod
vertex_values = u.compute_vertex_values(mesh)
!ec
Both `dofs` and `vertex_values` will be `numpy` arrays and they will
be of the same length and contain the same values, but with possibly
different ordering. The array `vertex_values` will have the same
ordering as the vertices of the mesh, while `dofs` will be ordered in
a way that (nearly) minimizes the bandwidth of the system matrix and
thus improves the efficiency of linear solvers.

A fundamental question is: What are the
coordinates of vertex `i` whose value is `dofs[i]`? To answer this
question, we need to understand how to get our hands on the
coordinates, and in particular, the numbering of degrees of freedom
and the numbering of vertices in the mesh.

The function `mesh.coordinates()` returns the coordinates of the
vertices as a `numpy` array with shape $(M,d$), $M$ being the number
of vertices in the mesh and $d$ being the number of space dimensions:

!bc pyshell
>>> from fenics import *
>>>
>>> mesh = UnitSquareMesh(2, 2)
>>> coordinates = mesh.coordinates()
>>> coordinates
array([[ 0. ,  0. ],
       [ 0.5,  0. ],
       [ 1. ,  0. ],
       [ 0. ,  0.5],
       [ 0.5,  0.5],
       [ 1. ,  0.5],
       [ 0. ,  1. ],
       [ 0.5,  1. ],
       [ 1. ,  1. ]])
!ec
We see from this output that for this particular mesh, the vertices
are first numbered along $y=0$
with increasing $x$ coordinate, then along $y=0.5$, and so on.

Next we compute a function `u` on this mesh. Let's take $u=x+y$:

!bc pyshell
>>> V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 1)
>>> u = interpolate(Expression('x[0] + x[1]'), V)
>>> plot(u, interactive=True)
>>> dofs = u.vector().array()
>>> dofs
array([ 1. ,  0.5,  1.5,  0. ,  1. ,  2. ,  0.5,  1.5,  1. ])
!ec
We observe that `dofs[0]` is *not* the value of $x+y$ at vertex number 0,
since this vertex has coordinates $x=y=0$. The numbering of the
degrees of freedom $U_1,\ldots,U_{N}$ is obviously not the same as the
numbering of the vertices.

In the plot window, we may take a closer look at the function `u` and
the vertex numbering. We type `w` to turn on wireframe instead of
a fully  colored surface, `m` to show the mesh, and then `v` to show the
numbering of the vertices.

FIGURE: [fig/vertex_numbering, width=500 frac=0.8]

idx{compute vertex values}
idx{vertex values}

Let's instead examine the values we get by calling
`u.compute_vertex_values()`:

!bc pyshell
>>> vertex_values = u.compute_vertex_values()
>>> for i, x in enumerate(coordinates):
...     print('vertex %d: vertex_values[%d] = %g\tu(%s) = %g' %
...           (i, i, vertex_values[i], x, u(x)))
vertex 0: vertex_values[0] = 0  	u([ 0.  0.]) = 8.46545e-16
vertex 1: vertex_values[1] = 0.5	u([ 0.5  0. ]) = 0.5
vertex 2: vertex_values[2] = 1          u([ 1.  0.]) = 1
vertex 3: vertex_values[3] = 0.5	u([ 0.   0.5]) = 0.5
vertex 4: vertex_values[4] = 1          u([ 0.5  0.5]) = 1
vertex 5: vertex_values[5] = 1.5	u([ 1.   0.5]) = 1.5
vertex 6: vertex_values[6] = 1          u([ 0.  1.]) = 1
vertex 7: vertex_values[7] = 1.5	u([ 0.5  1. ]) = 1.5
vertex 8: vertex_values[8] = 2          u([ 1.  1.]) = 2
!ec

idx{vertex to dof map}
idx{dof to vertex map}

We can ask FEniCS to give us the mapping from vertices to degrees of
freedom for a certain function space $V$:

!bc pycod
v2d = vertex_to_dof_map(V)
!ec
Now, `dofs[v2d[i]]` will give us the value of the degree of freedom in
`u` corresponding to vertex `i` (`v2d[i]`). In particular, `dofs[v2d]`
is an array with all the elements in the same (vertex numbered) order
as `coordinates`.  The inverse map, from degrees of freedom number to
vertex number is given by `dof_to_vertex_map(V)`, so
`coordinates[dof_to_vertex_map(V)]` results in an array of all the
coordinates in the same order as the degrees of freedom.

For Lagrange elements of degree larger than 1, there are degrees of
freedom (nodes) that do not correspond to vertices. For these
elements, we may still ask FEniCS to compute the vertex values by
calling `u.compute_vertex_values(mesh)`, and we can get the degrees of
freedom by calling `u.vector().array()`. To get the coordinates
associated with all degrees of freedom, we need to iterate over the
elements of the mesh and ask FEniCS to return the coordinates and dofs
associated with each cell. This information is stored in the
`FiniteElement` and `DofMap` object of a `FunctionSpace`. The
following code illustrates how to iterate over all elements of a mesh and
print the degrees of freedom and coordinates associated with the
element.

!bc pycod
element = V.element()
dofmap = V.dofmap()
for cell in cells(mesh):
    print(element.tabulate_dof_coordinates(cell))
    print(dofmap.cell_dofs(cell.index()))
!ec

#@@@CODE src/poisson_iter.py fromto: def compare_exact@def normalize
#As expected, the error is either identically zero or about $10^{-15}$ or
#$10^{-16}$.

!bwarning Cheap vs expensive function evaluation
Given a `Function` object `u`, we can evaluate its values in various
ways:

 o `u(x)` for an arbitrary point `x`
 o `u.vector().array()[i]` for degree of freedom number `i`
 o `u.compute_vertex_values()[i]` at vertex number `i`

The first method, though very flexible, is in general expensive
while the other two are very efficient (but limited to certain points).
!ewarning

To demonstrate the use of point evaluations of `Function` objects, we
write out the computed `u` at the center point of the domain and
compare it with the exact solution:

!bc pycod
center = (0.5, 0.5)
error = u_D(center) - u(center)
print('Error at %s: %g' % (center, error))
!ec
Trying on a $2\times(3\times 3)$ mesh, the output from the
previous snippet becomes

!bc dat
Error at (0.5, 0.5): -0.0833333
!ec
The discrepancy is due to the fact that the center point is not a node
in this particular mesh, but a point in the interior of a cell, and
`u` varies linearly over the cell while `u_D` is a quadratic
function. When the center point is a node, as in a $2\times(2\times
2)$ or $2\times(4\times 4)$ mesh, the error is of the order
$10^{-15}$.

We have seen how to extract the nodal values in a `numpy` array.
If desired, we can adjust the nodal values too. Say we want to
normalize the solution such that $\max_j |U_j| = 1$. Then we
must divide all $U_j$ values
by $\max_j |U_j|$. The following function performs the task:

[AL: Why is it called `poisson_iter.py`? Don't understand the logic
behind the name...]
[hpl: Poission equation with iterative mthods. Now explained at the very
end of the section.]

@@@CODE src/poisson_iter.py fromto: def normalize@def test_normalize
That is, we manipulate `dofs` as desired, and then we insert this
array into `u`'s `Vector` object.  The `/=` operator implies an
in-place modification of the object on the left-hand side: all
elements of the array `dofs` are divided by the value `u_max`.
Alternatively, one could write `dofs = dofs / u_max`, which
implies creating a new array on the right-hand side and assigning this
array to the name `dofs`.

!bwarning Be careful when manipulating degrees of freedom
A call like `u.vector().array()` returns a *copy* of the data in
`u.vector()`. One must therefore never perform assignments like
`u.vector.array()[:] = ...`, but instead extract the `numpy` array
(i.e., a copy), manipulate it, and insert it back with `u.vector()[:]
= ` or use `u.set_local(...)`.

===== Parameterizing the number of space dimensions =====
label{ch:poisson0:nD}
idx{dimension-independent code}

[AL: Use consistent mesh resolution, perhaps 16 for all examples. Now
the resolution looks very random between examples.]
[hpl: True, but the randomness stems from the fact that 2 is enough for
most examples, so anything works. I agree that 16 is a better number
to display (and copy), and if we choose the extreme 2, there is an explanation
in the text for that choice.]
[AL: I'm changing everything to 16 from now on for consistency. With
today's computers, 16 is a reasonably small problem and a nice
number. Needs to be revisited throughout the book! If we use 16, it is
clear that 16 is a nice ''round'' number but 6, 4, 5 may look like
something special - why make the mesh anisotropic?]
[hpl: OK!]


FEniCS makes it is easy to write a unified simulation code that can
operate in 1D, 2D, and 3D. We will conveniently make use of this
feature in forthcoming examples.  As an appetizer, go back to the
introductory programs `${prog["poisson"]}.py` or
`${prog["poisson_func"]}.py` and change the mesh construction from
`UnitSquareMesh(16, 16)` to `UnitCubeMesh(16, 16, 16)`. Now the domain is
the unit cube partitioned into $16\times 16\times16$|$16x16x16$ boxes, and
each box is divided into six tetrahedron-shaped finite elements for
computations. Run the program and observe that we can solve a 3D
problem without any other modifications (!). The visualization allows
you to rotate the cube and observe the function values as colors on
the boundary.

If we want to parameterize the creation of unit interval, unit square,
or unit cube over dimension, we can do so by encapsulating this part
of the code in a function. Given a list or tuple with the divisions
into cells in the various spatial coordinates, the following function
returns the mesh for a $d$-dimensional cube:

!bc pycod
def UnitHyperCube(divisions):
    mesh_classes = [UnitIntervalMesh, UnitSquareMesh, UnitCubeMesh]
    d = len(divisions)
    mesh = mesh_classes[d-1](*divisions)
    return mesh
!ec
The construction `mesh_class[d-1]` will pick the right name of the
object used to define the domain and generate the mesh.  Moreover, the
argument `*divisions` sends all the components of the list `divisions`
as separate arguments to the constructor of the mesh construction
class picked out by `mesh_class[d-1]`. For example, in a 2D problem
where `divisions` has two elements, the statement

!bc pycod
mesh = mesh_classes[d-1](*divisions)
!ec
is equivalent to

!bc pycod
mesh = UnitSquareMesh(divisions[0], divisions[1])
!ec

Replacing the `Nx` and `Ny` parameters by `divisions` and calling the
function `UnitHyperCube` to create the mesh are the two modifications
that we need in any of the previously shown `solver` functions to turn
them into solvers for $d$-dimensional problems. Note that
`UnitHyperCube` is a *function* and not a *class* but we have named it
with *CamelCase* to make it look like a class so that our programs
look similar to using the standard FEniCS mesh classes:

!bc pycod
mesh = UnitHyperCube(divisions)
!ec

In the string for an `Expression` object, `pi` is the value of
$\pi$. Also note that $\pi^2$ must be expressed with syntax
`pow(pi,2)` and not (the common Python syntax) `pi**2`.

FEniCS will abort with a compilation error if you type the expressions
in a wrong way syntax-wise.  Search for *error:* in the
`/very/long/path/compile.log` file mentioned in the error message to
see what the C++ compiler reported as error in the expressions.
!ehint

!bhint
The result that with P1 elements, doubling the resolution reduces the error
with a factor of four, is an
asymptotic result so it requires a sufficiently fine mesh. Here
one may start with $N_x=N_y=20$.
!ehint

!bsol
Looking at the `${prog["poisson"]}.py` code, we realize that
the following edits are required:

 * Modify the `mesh` computation.
 * Modify `u_b` and `f`.
 * Add expression for the exact solution.
 * Modify the computation of the numerical error.
 * Insert a loop to enable solving the problem twice.
 * Put the error reduction computation and the plot statements after the loop.

Here is the modified code:

@@@CODE exer/poisson_fsin_flat.py fromto: from fenics import@

The number $\pi$ has the symbol `M_PI` in C and C++, but in C++
strings in `Expression` objects, the symbol `pi` can be used directly
(or one can use the less readable `DOLFIN_PI`).

This exercise demonstrates that changing a flat program to solve a new
problem requires careful editing of statements scattered around in the
file, while
the solution in b), based on the `solver` function, requires *no modifications*
of the `${prog["poisson_func"]}.py` file, just
*minimalistic additional new code* in a separate file. The Poisson solver
remains in one place (`${prog["poisson_func"]}.py`) while in a) we got two
Poisson solvers. If you decide to switch to an iterative solution method
for linear systems, you can do so in one place in b), and all applications
can take advantage of the extension. Hopefully, with this exercise
you realize that embedding
PDE solvers in functions (or classes) makes more reusable software than

======= Working with linear solvers =======

Sparse LU decomposition (Gaussian elimination) is used by default to
solve linear systems of equations in FEniCS programs.  This is a very
robust and simple method. It is the recommended method for systems
with up to a few thousand unknowns and may hence be the method of
choice in many 2D and smaller 3D problems. However, sparse LU
decomposition becomes slow and one quickly runs out of memory for
larger problems. For large problems, we instead need to use *iterative
methods* which are faster and require much less memory. We will now
look at how to take advantage of state-of-the-art iterative solution
methods in FEniCS.

===== Controlling the solution process =====
label{ch:poisson0:solve:prm}

=== Choosing a linear solver and preconditioner ===

Preconditioned Krylov solvers is a type of popular iterative methods
that are easily accessible in FEniCS programs. The Poisson equation
results in a symmetric, positive definite system matrix, for which the
optimal Krylov solver is the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method. However,
the CG method requires boundary conditions to be implemented in a
symmetric way. This is not the case by default, so then a Krylov
solver for non-symmetric system, such as GMRES, is a better choice.
Incomplete LU factorization (ILU) is a popular and robust all-round
preconditioner, so let us try the GMRES-ILU pair:

!bc pycod
solve(a == L, u, bc)
      solver_parameters={'linear_solver': 'gmres',
                         'preconditioner': 'ilu'})
# Alternative syntax
solve(a == L, u, bc,
      solver_parameters=dict(linear_solver='gmres',
                             preconditioner='ilu'))
!ec
Section ref{ftut:app:solver:prec} lists the most popular choices of
Krylov solvers and preconditioners available in FEniCS.

idx{linear algebra backend}
idx{PETSc} idx{Eigen}

=== Choosing a linear algebra backend ===

The actual GMRES and ILU implementations that are brought into action
depend on the choice of linear algebra package. FEniCS interfaces
several linear algebra packages, called *linear algebra backends* in
FEniCS terminology. PETSc is the default choice if FEniCS is compiled
with PETSc. If PETSc is not available, then FEniCS falls back to using
the Eigen backend.

!bc pycod
parameters['linear_algebra_backend'] = backendname
!ec
where `backendname` is a string. To see which linear algebra backends
are available, you can call the FEniCS function
`list_linear_algebra_backends()`.

idx{`parameters` database}
idx{`info` function}

=== Setting solver parameters ===

We will normally like to control the tolerance in the stopping
criterion and the maximum number of iterations when running an
iterative method. Such parameters can be controlled at both a *global*
and *local* level. We will start by looking at how to set global
parameters. For more advanced programs, one may want to use a number
of different linear solvers and set different tolerances and other
parameters. Then it becomes important to control the parameters at a
*local* level. We will return to this issue in Section
ref{ch:poisson0:solver:problem}.

Changing a parameter in the global FEniCS parameter database affects
all linear solvers (created *after* the parameter has been set).
The global FEniCS parameter database is simply called `parameters` and
it behaves as a nested dictionary. Write

!bc pycod
info(parameters, verbose=True)
!ec
to list all parameters and their default values in the database.
The nesting of parameter sets is indicated through indentation in the
output from `info`.
According to this output, the relevant parameter set is
named `'krylov_solver'`, and the parameters are set like this:

!bc pycod
prm = parameters['krylov_solver'] # short form
prm['absolute_tolerance'] = 1E-10
prm['relative_tolerance'] = 1E-6
prm['maximum_iterations'] = 1000
!ec
Stopping criteria for Krylov solvers usually involve the norm of
the residual, which must be smaller than the absolute tolerance
parameter *or* smaller than the relative tolerance parameter times
the initial residual.

#To get a printout of the number of actual iterations to reach the
#topping criterion, we can insert
#
#!bc pycod
#set_log_level(PROGRESS)
## or
#set_log_level(DEBUG)
#!ec
#A message with the equation system size, solver type, and number of
#iterations arises from specifying the argument `PROGRESS`, while
#`DEBUG` results in more information, including CPU time spent in
#the various parts of the matrix assembly and solve process.

We remark that default values for the global parameter database can be
defined in an XML file. To generate such a file from the current set
of parameters in a program, run

!bc pycod
File('dolfin_parameters.xml') << parameters
!ec
If a `dolfin_parameters.xml` file is found in the directory where a
FEniCS program is run, this file is read and used to initialize the
`parameters` object. Otherwise, the file
`.config/fenics/dolfin_parameters.xml` in the user's home directory is
read, if it exists.  Another alternative is to load the XML (with any
name) manually in the program:

!bc pycod
File('dolfin_parameters.xml') >> parameters
!ec
The XML file can also be in gzip'ed form with the extension `.xml.gz`.

idx{`${prog["poisson_iter"]}.py`}

=== An extended solver function ===

We may extend the previous solver function from
`${prog["poisson_func"]}.py` in Section ref{ch:poisson0:impl2:func}
such that it also offers the GMRES+ILU
preconditioned Krylov solver:

!bc pycod
def solver(
    f, u_b, Nx, Ny,
    degree=1,               # Polynomial degree of function space
    linear_solver='Krylov', # Linear solver method (alt: 'direct')
    abs_tol=1E-5,           # Absolute tolerance in Krylov solver
    rel_tol=1E-3,           # Relative tolerance in Krylov solver
    max_iter=1000,          # Max iterations in Krylov solver
    log_level=PROGRESS,     # Amount of solver output
    print_parameters=False, # Print solver parameters to screen?
    ):
    ...
    # Set up variational problem: a, L, declare u, etc.

    if linear_solver == 'Krylov':
        prm = parameters['krylov_solver']
        prm['absolute_tolerance'] = abs_tol
        prm['relative_tolerance'] = rel_tol
        prm['maximum_iterations'] = max_iter
        print(parameters['linear_algebra_backend'])
        set_log_level(log_level)
        if dump_parameters:
            info(parameters, True)
        solver_parameters = {'linear_solver': 'gmres',
                             'preconditioner': 'ilu'}
    else:
        solver_parameters = {'linear_solver': 'lu'}

    solve(a == L, u, bc, solver_parameters=solver_parameters)
    return u
!ec
This new `solver` function, found in the file
`${prog["poisson_iter"]}.py`, replaces the one in `${prog["poisson_func"]}.py`:
it has all the functionality of the previous `solver` function,
but can also solve the linear system with
iterative methods and report the progress of such solvers.

=== A remark regarding unit tests ===

Regarding verification of the new `solver` function in terms of unit
tests, it turns out that unit testing for a problem where the
approximation error vanishes gets more complicated when we use
iterative methods. The problem is to keep the error due to iterative
solution smaller than the tolerance used in the verification
tests. First of all, this means that the tolerances used in the Krylov
solvers must be smaller than the tolerance used in the `assert` test,
but this is no guarantee to keep the linear solver error this small.
For linear elements and small meshes, a tolerance of $10^{-11}$ works
well in the case of Krylov solvers too (using a tolerance $10^{-12}$
in those solvers). However, as soon as we switch to $\mathsf{P}_2$
elements, it is hard to force the linear solver error below
$10^{-6}$. Consequently, tolerances in tests depend on the numerical
method being used. The interested reader is referred to the
`test_solver` function in `${prog["poisson_iter"]}.py` for details:
this function tests the numerical solution for direct and iterative
linear solvers, for different meshes, and different degrees of the
polynomials in the finite element basis functions.

===== List of linear solver methods and preconditioners =====
label{ftut:app:solver:prec}

Which linear solvers and preconditioners that are available
in FEniCS depends on how FEniCS has been configured and which
linear algebra backend is currently active. The following table
shows an example of which linear solvers that can be available
through FEniCS when the PETSc backend is active:

|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name            | Method                                        |

|`'umfpack'`      |  UMFPACK                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

The set of available preconditioners also depends on configuration and
linear algebra backend. The following table shows an example of which
preconditioners may be available:

|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                 | Method                                     |

===== Linear variational problem and solver objects =====
label{ch:poisson0:solver:problem}
idx{LinearVariationalProblem}
idx{LinearVariationalSolver}

idx{`${prog["poisson_iter"]}.py`}

The FEniCS interface allows different ways to access the core
functionality, ranging from very high-level to low-level access. So
far, we have mostly used the high-level call `solve(a == L, u, bc)` to
solve a variational problem `a == L` with a certain boundary condition
`bc`. However, sometimes you may need more fine-grained control over
the solution process. In particular, the call to `solve` will create
certain objects that are thrown away after the solution has been
computed, and it may be practical or efficient to *reuse* those
objects.

In this section, we will look an alternative interface to solving
linear variational problems in FEniCS, which may be preferable in
many situations compared to the high-level `solve` function interface.
This interface uses the two classes `LinearVariationalProblem` and
`LinearVariationalSolver`. Using this interface, the equivalent of
`solve(a == L, u, bc)` looks as follows:

!bc pycod
u = Function(V)
problem = LinearVariationalProblem(a, L, u, bc)
solver  = LinearVariationalSolver(problem)
solver.solve()
!ec

Many FEniCS objects have an attribute `parameters` corresponding to
a parameter set in the global `parameters` database,
but local to the object. Here, `solver.parameters` play that
role. Setting the CG method with ILU preconditioning as the solution
method and specifying solver-specific parameters can be done
like this:

!bc pycod
solver.parameters['linear_solver'] = 'gmres'
solver.parameters['preconditioner'] = 'ilu'
prm = solver.parameters['krylov_solver'] # short form
prm['absolute_tolerance'] = 1E-7
prm['relative_tolerance'] = 1E-4
prm['maximum_iterations'] = 1000
!ec
Settings in the global `parameters` database are
propagated to parameter sets in individual objects, with the
possibility of being overwritten as above. Note that global parameter
values can only affect local parameter values if set before the time
of creation of the local object. Thus, changing the value of the
tolerance in the global parameter database will not affect the
parameters for already created solvers.

The linear variational problem and solver objects as outlined above
are incorporated in an alternative solver function, named
`solver_objects`, in
`${prog["poisson_iter"]}.py`. Otherwise, this function is similar to the
previously shown `solver` function.

===== Explicit assembly and solve =====
label{ch:poisson0:linalg}

As we saw already in Section ref{ftut1:NS}, linear variational
problems can be assembled explicitly in FEniCS into matrices and
vectors using the `assemble` function. This allows even more
fine-grained control of the solution process compared to using the
high-level `solve` function or using the class
`LinearVariationalSolver`. We will now look more closely into how to
use the `assemble` function and how to combine this with low-level
calls for solving the assembled linear systems.

Given a variational problem $a(u,v)=L(v)$, the discrete solution $u$
is computed by inserting $u=\sum_{j=1}^N U_j \phi_j$ into $a(u,v)$ and
demanding $a(u,v)=L(v)$ to be fulfilled for $N$ test functions
$\hat\phi_1,\ldots,\hat\phi_N$. This implies

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{j=1}^N a(\phi_j,\hat\phi_i) U_j = L(\hat\phi_i),\quad i=1,\ldots,N,
\end{equation*}
!et
which is nothing but a linear system,

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  AU = b,
\end{equation*}
!et
where the entries of $A$ and $b$ are given by

!bt
\begin{align*}
  A_{ij} &= a(\phi_j, \hat{\phi}_i), \\
  b_i &= L(\hat\phi_i)\tp
\end{align*}
!et

idx{`assemble`}
idx{linear systems (in FEniCS)}
idx{assembly of linear systems}

The examples so far have specified the left- and right-hand sides of
the variational formulation and then asked FEniCS to assemble the
linear system and solve it. An alternative is to explicitly call
functions for assembling the coefficient matrix $A$ and the right-hand
side vector $b$, and then solve the linear system $AU=b$ for
the vector $U$. Instead of `solve(a == L, U, b)` we now write

!bc pycod
A = assemble(a)
b = assemble(L)
bc.apply(A, b)
u = Function(V)
U = u.vector()
solve(A, U, b)
!ec
The variables `a` and `L` are the same as before; that is, `a` refers
to the bilinear form involving a `TrialFunction` object `u`
and a `TestFunction` object `v`, and `L` involves the same `TestFunction`
object `v`. From `a` and `L`, the `assemble` function can compute
$A$ and $b$.

Creating the linear system explicitly in a program can have some
advantages in more advanced problem settings. For example, $A$ may
be constant throughout a time-dependent simulation, so we can avoid
recalculating $A$ at every time level and save a significant amount
of simulation time.

The matrix $A$ and vector $b$ are first assembled without
incorporating essential (Dirichlet) boundary conditions. Thereafter,
the call `bc.apply(A, b)` performs the necessary modifications of the
linear system such that `u` is guaranteed to equal the prescribed
boundary values. When we have multiple Dirichlet conditions stored in
a list `bcs`, we must apply each condition in `bcs` to the system:

!bc pycod
# bcs is a list of DirichletBC objects
for bc in bcs:
    bc.apply(A, b)
!ec

idx{`assemble_system`}

Alternatively, we can use the function `assemble_system`, which takes
the boundary conditions into account during the assembly of the matrix
and vector:

!bc pycod
A, b = assemble_system(a, L, bcs)
!ec
The `assemble_system` function is preferable to the combination of
`assemble` and `bc.apply` when the linear system is symmetric, since
`assembly_system` will incorporate the boundary conditions in a
symmetric way. Even if the matrix `A` that comes out of the call to
`assemble` for a symmetric bilinear form `a`, the call to `bc.apply`
will break the symmetry.

#That is, for each degree of freedom
#that is known, the corresponding row and column is zero'ed out and 1
#is placed on the main diagonal, and the right-hand side `b` is
#modified by subtracting the column in `A` times the value of the
#degree of, and then the corresponding entry in `b` is replaced by the
#known value of the degree of freedom.
#With `bc.apply(A, b)` the
#matrix `A` is modified in an nonsymmetric way.
#: The row is zero'ed out
#and 1 is placed on the main diagonal, and the degree of freedom value
#is inserted in `b`.

Once the linear system has been assembled, we need to compute the
solution $U=A^{-1}b$ and store the solution $U$ in the vector
`U = u.vector()`. In the same way as linear variational problems can be
programmed using different interfaces in FEniCS---the high-level
`solve` function, the class `LinearVariationalSolve`, and the
low-level `assemble` function---linear systems can also be programmed
using different interfaces in FEniCS. The high-level interface to
solving a linear system in FEniCS also named `solve`:

!bc pycod
solve(A, U, b)
!ec

By default, `solve(A, U, b)` uses sparse LU decomposition to compute
the solution. Specification of an iterative solver and preconditioner
can be made through two optional arguments:

!bc pycod
solve(A, U, b, 'cg', 'ilu')
!ec
Appropriate names of solvers and preconditioners are found in
Section ref{ftut:app:solver:prec}.

idx{KrylovSolver}

This high-level interface is useful for many applications, but
sometimes more fine-grained control is needed. One can then create one
or more `KrylovSolver` objects that are then used to solve linear
systems. Each different solver object can have its own set of
parameters and selection of iterative method and preconditioner. Here
is an example:

!bc pycod
solver = KrylovSolver('cg', 'ilu')
prm = solver.parameters
prm['absolute_tolerance'] = 1E-7
prm['relative_tolerance'] = 1E-4
prm['maximum_iterations'] = 1000
u = Function(V)
U = u.vector()
solver.solve(A, U, b)
!ec
The function `solver_linalg` in the program file
`${prog["poisson_iter"]}.py` implements a solver function where the user
can choose between different types of assembly. The function
`application_linalg` runs a test problem on a sequence of meshes and
solves the problem with symmetric and non-symmetric modification of
the system matrix. One can monitor the number of Krylov method
iterations and realize that with a symmetric coefficient matrix, the
Conjugate Gradient method requires slightly fewer iterations than
GMRES in the non-symmetric case. Taking into account that the
Conjugate Gradient method has less work per iteration, there is some
efficiency to be gained by using `assemble_system` for this problem.

[hpl: Running `application_linalg`, the results are strange: Why does
the `solve(a==L,...)` method need many more iterations than `solve(A,
U, b, ...)` when we use the same Krylov parameter settings? Something
wrong with the settings?]

[AL: I don't know. I found a possibly related problem in that
`monitor_convergence = True` had no effect when calling `solve` but it
worked when setting it on a solver object. Will need to revisit and
test run all codes later with latest FEniCS.]
[hpl: OK.]

idx{random start vector (linear systems)}

The choice of start vector for the iterations in a linear solver is
often important. By default, the values of `u` and thus the vector `U
= u.vector()` will be initialized to zero. If instead wanted to
initialize `U` with random numbers in the interval $[-100,100]$ this
can be done as follows:

!bc pycod
n = u.vector().array().size
U = u.vector()
U[:] = numpy.random.uniform(-100, 100, n)
solver.parameters['nonzero_initial_guess'] = True
solver.solve(A, U, b)
!ec
Note that we must both turn off the default behavior of setting the start
vector (``initial guess'') to zero, and also set the values of the
vector `U` to nonzero values.

Using a nonzero initial guess can be particularly important for
time-dependent problems or when solving a linear system as part of a
nonlinear iteration, since then the previous solution vector `U` will
often be a good initial guess for the solution in the next time step
or iteration.

# In other problems, we may divide the variational
# problem and linear system into different terms, say $A=M + {\dt} K$,
# where $M$ is a matrix arising from a term like $\partial u/\partial t$,
# $K$ is a term corresponding to a Laplace operator, and $\dt$ is
# a time discretization parameter. When $\dt$ is changed in time,
# we can efficiently recompute $A = M + {\dt} K$ without
# reassembling the constant matrices $M$ and $K$. This strategy may
# speed up simulations significantly.

===== Examining matrix and vector values =====

When calling `A = assemble(a)` and `b = assemble(L)`, the object `A`
will be of type `Matrix`, while `b` and `u.vector()` are of type
`Vector`. To examine the values, we may convert the matrix and vector
data to `numpy` arrays by calling the `array()` method as shown
before. For example, if you wonder how essential boundary conditions are
incorporated into linear systems, you can print out `A` and `b`
before and after the `bc.apply(A, b)` call:

!bc pycod
A = assemble(a)
b = assemble(L)
if mesh.num_cells() < 16: # print for small meshes only
    print(A.array())
    print(b.array())
bc.apply(A, b)
if mesh.num_cells() < 16:
    print(A.array())
    print(b.array())
!ec

With access to the elements in `A` through a `numpy` array, we can easily
perform computations on this matrix, such as computing the eigenvalues
(using the `eig` function in `numpy.linalg`). We can alternatively dump
`A.array()` and `b.array()` to file in MATLAB format and invoke
MATLAB or Octave to analyze the linear system.
Dumping the arrays to MATLAB format is done by

!bc pycod
import scipy.io
scipy.io.savemat('Ab.mat', {'A': A.array(), 'b': b.array()})
!ec
Writing `load Ab.mat` in MATLAB or Octave will then make
the array variables `A` and `b` available for computations.

idx{SLEPc}

Matrix processing in Python or MATLAB/Octave is only feasible for
small PDE problems since the `numpy` arrays or matrices in MATLAB file
format are dense matrices. FEniCS also has an interface to the
eigensolver package SLEPc, which is the preferred tool for computing
the eigenvalues of large, sparse matrices of the type encountered in
PDE problems (see `demo/documented/eigenvalue` in the FEniCS source
code tree for a demo).

[AL: Aha, so vc means variable coefficient. Seems to be a mismatch
between presenting the example here below and using referring to the
example above.]
[hpl: Moved the code to avoid this mismatch.]

[AL: I changed the title here and put everything under the common
theme 'post-processing' since flux computation and structured grids
are also related to postprocessing (more than to variable coefficient
Poisson).]
[hpl: Fine.]

======= Postprocessing computations =======
label{ftut:possion:2D:varcoeff}
idx{Poisson's equation with variable coefficient}
idx{Postprocessing}
idx{`${prog["poisson_vc"]}.py`}

As the final theme in this chapter, we will look at how to perform
*postprocessing computations*; that is, how to compute various derived
quantities from the computed solution of a PDE. The solution $u$
itself may be of interest for visualizing general features of the
solution, but sometimes one is interested in computing the solution of
a PDE to compute a specific quantity that derives from the solution,
such as, e.g., the flux, a point-value, or some average of the
solution.

===== A variable-coefficient Poisson problem =====

As a test problem, we will extend the Poisson problem from Chapter
ref{ch:fundamentals} with a variable coefficient $p(x,y)$ in the
Laplace operator:

!bt
\begin{equation} label{ch:poisson0:2D:varcoeff}
  \begin{split}
    - \nabla\cdot \left\lbrack
p(x,y)\nabla u(x,y)\right\rbrack &= f(x,y) \quad \mbox{in } \Omega,
    \\
    u(x,y) &= \ub(x,y) \quad \mbox{on}\  \partial\Omega\tp
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
!et
Let us continue to use our favorite solution $u(x,y)=1+x^2+2y^2$ and
then prescribe $p(x,y)=x+y$. It follows that
$\ub(x,y) = 1 + x^2 + 2y^2$ and $f(x,y)=-8x-10y$.

We shall quickly demonstrate that this simple extension of our model
problem only requires an equally simple extension of the FEniCS
program. The following simple changes must be made to the previously
shown codes:

  * the `solver` function must take `p` as argument,
  * the right-hand side `f`
    must be an `Expression` since it is no longer a constant,
  * a new `Expression p` must be defined for the variable coefficient,
  * the formula for $a(u,v)$ in the variational problem must be updated.

We first address the modified variational problem. Multiplying
the PDE by a test function $v$ and
integrating by parts now results
in

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\int_\Omega p\nabla u\cdot\nabla v \dx -
\int_{\partial\Omega} p{\partial u\over
\partial n}v \ds = \int_\Omega fv \dx\tp
\end{equation*}
!et
The function spaces for $u$ and $v$ are the same as in
the problem with $p=1$, implying that the boundary integral
vanishes since $v=0$ on $\partial\Omega$ where we have Dirichlet conditions.
The variational forms $a$ and $L$ in the variational problem
$a(u,v)=L(v)$ then become

!bt
\begin{equation}
a(u,v) = \int_\Omega p\nabla u\cdot\nabla v \dx,\quad
L(v) = \int_\Omega fv \dx\tp
\end{equation}
!et
In the code for solving $-\nabla^2u=f$ we must thus replace

!bc pycod
a = dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
!ec
by

!bc pycod
a = p*dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
!ec
to solve $-\nabla\cdot(p\nabla u)=f$. Moreover,
the definitions of `p` and `f` in the test problem read

!bc pycod
p = Expression('x[0] + x[1]')
f = Expression('-8*x[0] - 10*x[1]')
!ec
No additional modifications are necessary. The file
`${prog["poisson_vc"]}.py` (Poisson problem, variable coefficients)
is a copy of `${prog["poisson_iter"]}.py` with the mentioned changes
incorporated. Observe that $p=1$ recovers the original problem in
`${prog["poisson_iter"]}.py`.

[hpl: Is `poisson_varcoeff.py` a better name?]

You can execute the file and confirm that it recovers the exact solution $u$ at
the nodes.

===== Flux computations =====
label{ch:poisson0:gradu}

idx{projection}

It is often of interest to compute the flux $Q = -p\nabla u$ is often of interest to compute. Since
$u = \sum_{j=1}^N U_j \phi_j$, it follows that

!bt
\begin{equation*}
Q = -p\sum_{j=1}^N U_j \nabla \phi_j\tp
\end{equation*}
!et

However, the gradient of a piecewise continuous finite element scalar
field is a discontinuous vector field since the basis functions
$\{\phi_j\}$ have discontinuous derivatives at the boundaries of the
cells. For example, using Lagrange elements of degree 1, $u$ is linear
over each cell, and the gradient becomes a piecewise
constant vector field. On the contrary, the exact gradient is
continuous. For visualization and data analysis purposes, we often
want the computed gradient to be a continuous vector field. Typically,
we want each component of $\nabla u$ to be represented in the same way
as $u$ itself. To this end, we can project the components of $\nabla
u$ onto the same function space as we used for $u$. This means that
we solve $w = \nabla u$ approximately by a finite element method,
using the same elements for the components of $w$ as we used for
$u$. This process is known as *projection*.

idx{`project`} idx{projection}

Projection is a common operation in finite element analysis and FEniCS
has a function for easily performing the projection:
`project(expression, W)`, which returns the projection of some
expression into the space `W`. In our case, the flux $Q = -p\nabla u$
is vector-valued and we need to pick `W` as the vector-valued function
space of the same degree as the space `V` where `u` resides:

!bc pycod
V = u.function_space()
mesh = V.mesh()
degree = V.ufl_element().degree()
W = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh(), 'P', degree)

grad_u = project(grad(u), W)
flux_u = project(-p*grad(u), W)
!ec

#Figure ref{ch:poisson0:2D:fig:ex1:gradu} shows
#example of how such a smoothed `gradu(u)` vector field is visualized.
#FIGURE:[fig/ex1_gradu, width=480] Example of visualizing the vector field $\nabla u$ by arrows at the nodes. label{ch:poisson0:2D:fig:ex1:gradu}

An appropriate function for computing the flux based on `u` and `p` is

@@@CODE src/poisson_vc.py fromto: def flux@def application_test_flux

The applications of projection are many, including turning discontinuous
gradient fields into continuous ones, comparing higher- and lower-order
function approximations, and transforming a higher-order finite element
solution down to a piecewise linear field, which is required by many
visualization packages.

Plotting the flux vector field is naturally as easy as plotting
anything else:

!bc pycod
plot(flux, title='flux field')

flux_x, flux_y = flux.split(deepcopy=True) # extract components
plot(flux_x, title='x-component of flux (-p*grad(u))')
plot(flux_y, title='y-component of flux (-p*grad(u))')
!ec
The `deepcopy=True` argument signifies a *deep copy*, which is
a general term in computer science implying that a copy of the data is
returned. (The opposite, `deepcopy=False`,
means a *shallow copy*, where
the returned objects are just pointers to the original data.)

idx{degrees of freedom array}
idx{nodal values array}
idx{degrees of freedom array (vector field)}

For data analysis of the nodal values of the flux field we can
grab the underlying `numpy` arrays (which demands a `deepcopy=True`
in the split of `flux`):

[AL: Suggest we use `_dofs` instead of `_array` everywhere. Have made
similar changes in previous chapters before.]
[hpl: OK! But found quite some `u_array` in the very first Poisson
example. Should we keep the name there and `dofs` everywhere else,
after the difference in numbering is explained? Sounds consistent to me.]

!bc pycod
flux_x_dofs = flux_x.vector().dofs()
flux_y_dofs = flux_y.vector().dofs()
!ec
The degrees of freedom of the `flux_u` vector field can also be
reached by

!bc pycod
flux_u_dofs = flux_u.vector().array()
!ec
However, this is a flat `numpy` array containing the degrees of
freedom for both the $x$ and $y$ components of the flux and the
ordering of the components may be mixed up by FEniCS in order to
improve computational efficiency.

The function `application_test_flux` in the program
`${prog["poisson_vc"]}.py` demonstrates the computations described
above.

!bnotice Manual projection.
Although you will always use `project` to project a finite element
function, it can be instructive to look at how to formulate the
projection mathematically and implement its steps manually in FEniCS.

Let's say we have an expression $g = g(u)$ that we want to project
into some space $W$. The mathematical formulation of the ($L^2$)
projection $w = P_W g$ into $W$ is the variational problem

!bt
\begin{equation}
  \int_{\Omega} w v \dx = \int_{\Omega} g v \dx
\end{equation}
!et
for all test functions $v$. In other words we have a
standard variational problem $a(w, v) = L(v)$ where now
!bt
\begin{align}
a(w, v) &= \int_\Omega w v \dx,\\
L(v) &= \int_\Omega g v \dx\tp
\end{align}
!et
Note that when the functions in $W$ are vector-valued, as is the case
when we project the gradient $g(u) = \nabla u$, we must replace the
products above by $w\cdot v$ and $g\cdot v$.

The variational problem is easy to define in FEniCS.
!bc pycod
w = TrialFunction(W)
v = TestFunction(W)

a = w*v*dx # or dot(w, v)*dx when w is vector-valued
L = g*v*dx # or dot(g, v)*dx when g is vector-valued
w = Function(W)
solve(a == L, w)
!ec
The boundary condition argument to `solve` is dropped since there are
no essential boundary conditions in this problem.

===== Taking advantage of structured mesh data =====
label{ftut:structviz}
idx{structured mesh}
idx{visualization, structured mesh}
idx{`scitools`}

[AL: I haven't read this section yet. Is it necessary to include? If
we need to save pages, this is the section I would drop. Since we can
easily visualize unstructured mesh data, this looks to me like a
complicated way to perform something we can already do by calling
`plot` or saving to Paraview. It also relies on a non-standard utility (`BoxField`).]
[hpl: A lot of readers come from the finite difference world and
also from MATLAB computations of 2D scalar and vector fields. These are
used to structured meshes and corresponding tools. At least students
will ask you why you cannot to MATLAB-style data analysis in 2D/3D arrays
when you have solved Poisson on a square. We may move to vol II, but
I refer to these recipes so often that they need to be documented somewhere,
and the FEniCS tutorial is natural...]

Many readers have extensive experience with visualization and data
analysis of 1D, 2D, and 3D scalar and vector fields on *uniform,
structured meshes*, while FEniCS solvers exclusively work with
*unstructured* meshes.  The collection software and mathematical
techniques for investigating scalar and vector fields on structured
meshes is much broader than for the unstructured ones, so when we
finite element computations actually take place on a uniform,
structured mesh, it is advantageous to extract the results in data
structures based on a structured mesh assumption. The present section
shows how that can be done. It allows, for example, standard
techniques in MATLAB or NumPy to be used to analyze finite element
computations.
#FEniCS users who apply FEniCS primarily for verifying their own tailored codes
#will make use of such techniques.

idx{`BoxField`}

A necessary first step is to transform our `mesh` object to an object
representing a rectangle with equally-shaped *rectangular* cells.  The
second step is to transform the one-dimensional array of nodal values
to a two-dimensional array holding the values at the corners of the
cells in the structured mesh. We want to access a value by its $i$ and
$j$ indices, $i$ counting cells in the $x$ direction, and $j$ counting
cells in the $y$ direction.  This transformation is in principle
straightforward, yet it frequently leads to obscure indexing errors,
so using software tools to ease the work is advantageous.

In the directory `src/modules`, associated with this booklet, we have
included a Python module `BoxField` that can take a finite element
function `u` computed by a FEniCS software and represent it on a
structured box-shaped mesh and assign or extract values by
multi-dimensional indexing: `[i]` in 1D, `[i,j]` in 2D, and `[i,j,k]`
in 3D. Given a finite element function `u`, the following function
returns a `BoxField` object that represents `u` on a structured mesh:

@@@CODE src/poisson_vc.py fromto: def structured_mesh@def application_structured_mesh
Note that we can only turn functions on meshes with P1 elements into
`BoxField` objects, so if `u` is based on another element type, we first
interpolate the scalar field onto a mesh with P1 elements. Also note
that to use the
function, we need to know the divisions into cells in the various
spatial directions (`divisions`).

The `u_box` object contains several useful data structures:

 * `u_box.grid`: object for the structured mesh
 * `u_box.grid.coor[X]`: grid coordinates in `X=0` direction
 * `u_box.grid.coor[Y]`: grid coordinates in `Y=1` direction
 * `u_box.grid.coor[Z]`: grid coordinates in `Z=2` direction
 * `u_box.grid.coorv[X]`: vectorized version of `u_box.grid.coor[X]`
   (for vectorized computations or surface plotting)
 * `u_box.grid.coorv[Y]`: vectorized version of `u_box.grid.coor[Y]`
 * `u_box.grid.coorv[Z]`: vectorized version of `u_box.grid.coor[Z]`
 * `u_box.values`: `numpy` array holding the `u` values;
   `u_box.values[i,j]` holds `u` at the mesh point with coordinates <linebreak>
   `(u_box.grid.coor[X], u_box.grid.coor[Y])`

=== Iterating over points and values ===

Let us go back to the `solver` function in the
`${prog["poisson_vc"]}.py` code from
Section ref{ftut:possion:2D:varcoeff}, compute `u`, map it onto a
`BoxField` object for a structured mesh representation, and
write out the coordinates and function values at all mesh points:

!bc pycod
u = solver(p, f, u_b, nx, ny, 1, linear_solver='direct')
u_box = structured_mesh(u, (nx, ny))
u_ = u_box.values       # numpy array
X = 0;  Y = 1           # for indexing in x and y direction

# Iterate over 2D mesh points (i,j)
print('u_ is defined on a structured mesh with %s points' %
      str(u_.shape))
for j in range(u_.shape[1]):
    for i in range(u_.shape[0]):
        print('u[%d,%d]=u(%g,%g)=%g' %
              (i, j,
               u_box.grid.coor[X][i], u_box.grid.coor[X][j],
               u_[i,j]))
!ec

=== Finite difference approximations ===

Note that with `u_`, we can easily express finite difference approximation
of derivatives:

!bc pycod
x = u_box.grid.coor[X]
dx = x[1] - x[0]
u_xx = (u_[i-1,j] - 2*u_[i,j] + u_[i+1,j])/dx**2
!ec

idx{surface plot (structured mesh)}

=== Surface plot ===

The ability to access a finite element field in the way one can access
a finite difference-type of field is handy in many occasions, including
visualization and data analysis.
With Matplotlib we can create a surface plot, see
Figure ref{ftut:structviz:fig1} (upper left):

!bc pycod
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
from matplotlib import cm
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
cv = u_box.grid.coorv  # vectorized mesh coordinates
ax.plot_surface(cv[X], cv[Y], u_, cmap=cm.coolwarm,
                rstride=1, cstride=1)
plt.title('Surface plot of solution')
!ec
The key issue is to know that the coordinates needed for the surface
plot is in `u_box.grid.coorv` and that the values are in `u_`.

FIGURE: [fig/poisson_vc_structmesh2, width=800 frac=1] Various plots of the solution on a structured mesh. label{ftut:structviz:fig1}


idx{contour plot}

=== Contour plot ===

A contour plot can also be made by Matplotlib:

!bc pycod
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca()
levels = [1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.5]
cs = ax.contour(cv[X], cv[Y], u_, levels=levels)
plt.clabel(cs)  # add labels to contour lines
plt.axis('equal')
plt.title('Contour plot of solution')
!ec
The result appears in Figure ref{ftut:structviz:fig1} (upper right).


=== Curve plot through the mesh ===

A handy feature of `BoxField` objects is the ability to give a start
point in the grid and a direction, and then extract the field and
corresponding coordinates along the nearest line of mesh points. In 3D fields
one can also extract data in a plane.  Say we want to plot $u$ along
the line $y=0.4$. The mesh points, `x`, and the $u$ values
along this line, `u_val`, are extracted by

!bc pycod
start = (0, 0.4)
X = 0
x, u_val, y_fixed, snapped = u_box.gridline(start, direction=X)
!ec
The variable `snapped` is true if the line had to be snapped onto a
gridline and in that case `y_fixed` holds the snapped
(altered) $y$ value. To avoid interpolation in the structured mesh,
`snapped` is in fact *always* true.

A comparison of the numerical and exact solution along the line
$y=0.5$ (snapped from $y=0.4$) is made by the following code:

!bc pycod
start = (0, 0.4)
x, u_val, y_fixed, snapped = u_box.gridline(start, direction=X)
u_e_val = [u_b((x_, y_fixed)) for x_ in x]

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, u_val, 'r-')
plt.plot(x, u_e_val, 'bo')
plt.legend(['P1 elements', 'exact'], loc='upper left')
plt.title('Solution along line y=%g' % y_fixed)
plt.xlabel('x');  plt.ylabel('u')
!ec
See Figure ref{ftut:structviz:fig1} (lower left) for the resulting curve plot.

=== Curve plot of the flux ===

Let us also compare the numerical and
exact flux $-p\partial u/\partial x$ along the same line as above:

!bc pycod
flux_u = flux(u, p)
flux_u_x, flux_u_y = flux_u.split(deepcopy=True)

# Plot the numerical and exact flux along the same line
flux2_x = flux_u_x if flux_u_x.ufl_element().degree() == 1 \
          else interpolate(flux_x,
               FunctionSpace(u.function_space().mesh(),
                             'P', 1))
flux_u_x_box = structured_mesh(flux_u_x, (nx,ny))
x, flux_u_val, y_fixed, snapped = \
   flux_u_x_box.gridline(start, direction=X)
y = y_fixed

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, flux_u_val, 'r-')
plt.plot(x, flux_u_x_exact(x, y_fixed), 'bo')
plt.legend(['P1 elements', 'exact'], loc='upper right')
plt.title('Flux along line y=%g' % y_fixed)
plt.xlabel('x');  plt.ylabel('u')
!ec
The second `plt.plot` command
requires a Python function `flux_u_x_exact(x,y)` to be
available for the exact flux expression.

Note that Matplotlib is one choice of plotting package. With the unified
interface in the "SciTools package": "https://github.com/hplgit/scitools" one
can access Matplotlib, Gnuplot, MATLAB, OpenDX, VisIt, and other plotting
engines through the same API.

idx{`sympy`}

=== Test problem ===

The graphics referred to in Figure ref{ftut:structviz:fig1} correspond to
a test problem with prescribed solution $\uex = H(x)H(y)$, where

!bt
\[ H(x) = e^{-16(x-\frac{1}{2})^2}\sin(3\pi x)\tp\]
!et
We just fit a function $f(x,y)$ in the PDE (can choose $p=1$),
and notice that $u=0$ along the
boundary of the unit square. Although it is easy to carry out the
differentiation of $f$ by hand and hardcode the resulting expressions
in an `Expression` object, a more reliable habit is to use Python's
symbolic computing engine, SymPy, to perform mathematics and
automatically turn formulas into C++ syntax for `Expression` objects.
A short introduction was given in
ref[Section ref{ftut:nonlinear:Newton:auto}][ in cite{ftut1}][the
section "A simple FEniCS implementation": "" in cite{ftut1}].

We start out with defining the exact solution in `sympy`:

!bc pycod
from sympy import exp, sin, pi  # for use in math formulas
import sympy as sym
H = lambda x: exp(-16*(x-0.5)**2)*sin(3*pi*x)
x, y = sym.symbols('x[0], x[1]')
u = H(x)*H(y)
!ec
Turning the expression for `u` into C or C++ syntax for `Expression` objects
needs two steps. First we ask for the C code of the expression,

!bc pycod
u_c = sym.printing.ccode(u)
!ec
Printing out `u_c` gives (the output is here manually broken into two
lines):

!bc
-exp(-16*pow(x[0] - 0.5, 2) - 16*pow(x[1] - 0.5, 2))*
sin(3*M_PI*x[0])*sin(3*M_PI*x[1])
!ec
The necessary syntax adjustment is replacing
the symbol `M_PI` for $\pi$ in C/C++ by `pi` (or `DOLFIN_PI`):

!bc pycod
u_c = u_c.replace('M_PI', 'pi')
u_b = Expression(u_c)
!ec

Thereafter, we can progress with the computation of $f = -\nabla\cdot(p\nabla u)$:

!bc pycod
p = 1
f = sym.diff(-p*sym.diff(u, x), x) + sym.diff(-p*sym.diff(u, y), y)
f = sym.simplify(f)
f_c = sym.printing.ccode(f)
f_c = f_c.replace('M_PI', 'pi')
f = Expression(f_c)
!ec
We also need a Python function for the exact flux $-p\partial u/\partial x$:

!bc pycod
flux_u_x_exact = sym.lambdify([x, y], -p*sym.diff(u, x),
                              modules='numpy')
!ec
It remains to define `p = Constant(1)` and set `nx` and `ny` before calling
`solver` to compute the finite element solution of this problem.


#FIGURE: [fig/poisson_vc_structmesh, width=800 frac=1] Various plots of the solution on a structured mesh. label{ftut:structviz:fig1a}


# #ifdef EXTRA
It should be easy with the information above to transform a finite
element field over a uniform rectangular or box-shaped mesh to the
corresponding `BoxField` object and perform MATLAB-style
visualizations of the whole field or the field over planes or along
lines through the domain.  By the transformation to a regular grid we
have some more flexibility than what the `plot` command in FEniCS
offers. However, we remark
that comprehensive tools like VisIt, MayaVi2, or ParaView also have
the possibility for plotting fields along lines and extracting planes
in 3D geometries, though usually with less degree of control compared
to Gnuplot, MATLAB, and Matplotlib.  For example, in investigations of
numerical accuracy or numerical artifacts one is often interested in
studying curve plots where only the nodal values sampled. This is
straightforward with a structured mesh data structure, but more
difficult in visualization packages utilizing unstructured grids, as
hitting exactly then nodes when sampling a function along a line
through the grid might be non-trivial.

===== Computing functionals =====
label{ch:poisson0:functionals}
idx{functionals}

After the solution $u$ of a PDE is computed, we occasionally want to compute
functionals of $u$, for example,

!bt
\begin{equation}
{1\over2}||\nabla u||^2 = {1\over2}\int_\Omega \nabla u\cdot \nabla u \dx,
label{ch:poisson0:functionals:energy}
\end{equation}
!et
which often reflects some energy quantity.
Another frequently occurring functional is the error

!bt
\begin{equation}
||\uex-u|| = \left(\int_\Omega (\uex-u)^2 \dx\right)^{1/2},
label{ch:poisson0:functionals:error}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\uex$ is the exact solution. The error is of particular
interest when studying convergence properties of finite element
methods. Other times, we may instead be interested in computing
the flux out of a part
$\Gamma$ of the boundary $\partial\Omega$,

!bt
\begin{equation}
F = -\int_\Gamma p\nabla u\cdot\normalvec \ds,
label{ch:poisson0:functionals:flux}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\normalvec$ is an outward unit normal at $\Gamma$ and $p$ is a
coefficient (see the problem in Section ref{ftut:possion:2D:varcoeff}
for a specific example).

All these functionals are easy to compute with FEniCS, as we shall see
in the examples below.

idx{energy functional}

=== Energy functional ===

The integrand of the energy functional
(ref{ch:poisson0:functionals:energy}) is described in the UFL
language in the same manner as we describe weak forms:

!bc pycod
energy = 0.5*dot(grad(u), grad(u))*dx
E = assemble(energy)
!ec
The functional `energy` is evaluated by calling the `assemble`
function that we have previously used to assemble matrices and
vectors. FEniCS will recognize that the form has ''rank 0'' (since it
contains no trial and test functions) and return the result as a
scalar value.

# #ifdef EXTRA
The function `energy` in `${prog["poisson_membrane"]}.py` carries out the computation of
the elastic energy

idx{`${prog["poisson_membrane"]}.py`}

[hpl: Things are right wrt scaling so far. The PDE is valid for
$\beta=0$ so use this case to check scaled energy expressions. Energy
is stress from a dimensional point of view: $\int
\sigma(\epsilon)d\epsilon = \int E\epsilon d\epsilon \sim E$. The
$\beta=0$ case corresponds to $A/(2\pi\sigma)$ constant on the
right-hand side in non-scaled coordinates. Must be something with
$\beta\rightarrow 0$, norm of $\nabla w$ goes to zero, no...not from
the exact solution from $w$.]

!bt
\begin{equation*}
{1\over2}||T\nabla D||^2 = {1\over2}\left(\frac{TD_c}{R}\right)^2R^2
||\bar\nabla w||^2 =

||\nabla w||^2 = \hbox{ no beta! }
\left(\frac{A}{8\pi}\right)^2\beta^2||\nabla w||^2
\end{equation*}
!et
in the membrane problem from Section ref{ch:poisson0:membrane}.
# #endif

idx{error functional}

=== Error functional ===

Computing the functional (ref{ch:poisson0:functionals:error}) can be
done as follows:
by

!bc pycod
error = (u - u_exact)**2*dx
E = sqrt(abs(assemble(error)))
!ec
The exact solution $\uex$ is here in a `Function` or `Expression`
object `u_exact`, while `u` is the finite element approximation.
Sometimes, for very small error values, the result of
`assemble(error)` can be a (very small) negative number, so we have
used `abs` in the expression for `E` above to ensure a positive value
for the `sqrt` function.

As will be explained and demonstrated in Section
ref{ch:poisson0:convrates}, the integration of `(u - u_exact)**2*dx`
can result in too optimistic convergence rates unless one is careful
how `u_exact` is transferred onto a mesh. The general recommendation
for reliable error computation is to use the `errornorm` function (see
`help(errornorm)` and Section ref{ch:poisson0:convrates} for
more information):

!bc pycod
E = errornorm(u_exact, u)
!ec

idx{flux functional}

=== Flux Functional ===

To compute flux integrals like $F = -\int_\Gamma p\nabla
u\cdot\normalvec \ds$, we need to define the $\normalvec$ vector,
referred to as *facet normal* in FEniCS. If the surface domain
$\Gamma$ in the flux integral is the complete boundary, we can perform
the flux computation by

!bc pycod
n = FacetNormal(mesh)
flux = -p*dot(grad(u), n)*ds
total_flux = assemble(flux)
!ec
Although `grad(u)` and `grad(u)` are interchangeable in the above
expression when `u` is a scalar function, we have chosen to write
`grad(u)` because this is the right expression if we generalize the
underlying equation to a vector Laplace/Poisson PDE. With `grad(u)` we
must in that case write `dot(n, grad(u))`.

[AL: Figure out which one is `grad` and which one is `nabla_grad`
above... :-)]
[hpl: Depends on what `u` is; no difference for scalar `u`, otherwise
I'm pretty sure the natural dyadic normal derivative has `n` coming in
from the left in the math so it should be `dot(n, nabla_grad(u))`.
We should change the formula then to `dot(n, grad(u))` even here.]

It is possible to restrict the integration to a part of the boundary
using a mesh function to mark the relevant part, as explained in
Section ref{ch:poisson0:multi:bc}. Assuming that the part corresponds
to subdomain number `i`, the relevant syntax for the variational
formulation of the flux is `-p*dot(grad(u), n)*ds(i)`.

===== Computing convergence rates =====
label{ch:poisson0:convrates}

[hpl: Newer FEniCS examples have `dx(degree)`. Should explain
that syntax. Also `Expression(string, degree)`.]

A central question for any numerical method is its *convergence rate*:
how fast does the error approach zero when the resolution is
increased? For finite element methods, this typically corresponds to
proving, theoretically or empirically, that the error $e = \uex - u$
is bounded by the mesh size $h$ to some power $r$; that is, $\|e\|
\leq C h^r$ for some constant $C$. The number $r$ is called the
*convergence rate* of the method. Note that different norms, like the
$L^2$-norm $\|e\|$ or $H^1_0$-norm $\|\nabla e\|$ typically have
different convergence rates.

To illustrate how to compute errors and convergence rates in FEniCS,
we have included the function `convergence_rate` in
`${prog["poisson_vc"]}.py`. This is a tool that is very handy
when verifying finite element codes and will therefore be explained in
detail here.

=== Computing error norms ===

The $L^2$-norm of the error in a finite element approximation $u$,
$\uex$ being the exact solution, is given by

!bt
\[ E = \left(\int_\Omega (u_e-u)^2 \dx\right)^{1/2},\]
!et
and can be implemented in FEniCS by

!bc pycod
error = (u - u_e)**2*dx
E = sqrt(abs(assemble(error)))
!ec
As above, we have used `abs` in the expression for `E` above to ensure
a positive value for the `sqrt` function.

It is important to understand how FEniCS computes the error from the
above code, since we may otherwise run into subtle issues when using
the value for computing convergence rates. The first subtle issue is
that if `u_e` is not already finite element function (an object create
using `Function(V)`), which is the case if `u_e` is defined as an
`Expression`, FEniCS must interpolate `u_e` into some local finite
element space on each element of the mesh. The degree used for the
interpolation is determined by the mandatory keyword argument to the
`Expression` class, for example:

!bc pycod
u_e = Expression('sin(x[0])', degree=1)
!ec
This means that the error computed will not be equal to the actual
error $\|\uex - u\|$ but rather the difference between the finite
element solution $u$ and the piecewise linear interpolant of
$\uex$. This may yield a too optimistic (too small) value for the
error. A better value may be achieved by interpolating the exact
solution into a higher-order function space, which can be done by
simply increasing the degree:

!bc pycod
u_e = Expression('sin(x[0])', degree=3)
!ec

The second subtle issue is that when FEniCS evaluates the expression
`(u_ex - u)**2`, this will be expanded into `u_ex**2 + u**2 -
2*u_ex*u`. If the error is small (and the solution itself is of
moderate size), this calculation will correspond to the subtraction of
two positive numbers (`u_ex**2 + u**2` $\sim 1$ and `2*u_ex*u` $\sim
1$) yielding a small number. Such a computation is very prone to
round-off errors, which may again lead to an unreliable value for the
error. To make this situation worse, FEniCS may expand this
computation into a large number of terms, in particular for higher
order elements, making the computation very unstable.

To help with these issues, FEniCS provides the built-in function
`errornorm` which computes the error norm in a more intelligent
way. First, both `u_ex` and `u` are interpolated into a higher-order
function space. Then, the degrees of freedom of `u_ex` and `u` are
subtracted to produce a new function in the higher-order function
space. Finally, FEniCS integrates the square of the difference
function to get the value of the error norm. Using the `errornorm`
function is simple:

!bc pycod
E = errornorm(u_e, u, normtype='L2')
!ec
It is illustrative to look at a short implementation of `errornorm`:

!bc pycod
def errornorm(u_exact, u):
    V = u.function_space()
    mesh = V.mesh()
    degree = V.ufl_element().degree()
    W = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', degree + 3)
    u_W = interpolate(u, W)
    u_e_W = interpolate(u_e, W)
    e_W = Function(W)

Sometimes it is of interest to compute the error of the
gradient field: $||\nabla (u-\uex)||$,
often referred to as the $H^1_0$ or $H^1$ seminorm of the error.
This can either be expressed as above, replacing the expression for
`error` by `error = dot(grad(e_W), grad(e_W))*dx`, or by calling
`errornorm` in FEniCS:

!bc pycod
E = errornorm(u_e, u, norm_type='H10')
!ec
Type `help(errornorm)` in Python for more information about available
norm types.

All the various types of error computations here are placed in a
function `compute_errors` in `${prog["poisson_vc"]}.py`:
[hpl: Necessary to repeat code? New info is essentiall the return dict.]
[hpl: Anders, I (in 2010...) ran into problems with `fenics.errornorm`,
see comments in the code below, and made the version below. We should
check out these problems again and adjust `fenics.errornorm` if
necessary.]
[AL: Have not yet checked code, will rerun all code and update
notation if necessary when I'm through with all text.]

@@@CODE src/poisson_vc.py fromto: def compute_errors@def convergence_rate

=== Computing convergence rates ===

Calling the `solver` function for finer and finer meshes enables us to
study the convergence rate. Define the element size $h=1/n$, where $n$
is the number of cell divisions in $x$ and $y$ direction (`n=Nx=Ny` in
the code). We perform experiments with $h_0>h_1>h_2\cdots$ and compute
the corresponding errors $E_0, E_1, E_2$ and so forth. Assuming
$E_i=Ch_i^r$ for unknown constants $C$ and $r$, we can compare two
consecutive experiments, $E_{i-1}=Ch_{i-1}^r$ and $E_i=Ch_i^r$, and
solve for $r$:

!bt
\begin{equation*}
r = {\ln(E_i/E_{i-1})\over\ln (h_i/h_{i-1})}\tp
\end{equation*}
!et
The $r$ values should approach the expected convergence rate
(typically the polynomial degree + 1 for the $L^2$-error) as $i$
increases.

The procedure above can easily be turned into Python code. Here
we run through a different types of elements (P1, P2, P3, and P4),
perform experiments over a series of refined meshes, and for
each experiment report the six error types as returned by `compute_errors`:

@@@CODE src/poisson_vc.py fromto: def convergence_rate\(@def convergence_rate_sin

=== Test problem ===

To demonstrate the computation of convergence rates, we will pick an
exact solution $\uex$ given by

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\uex(x,y) = \sin(\omega\pi x)\sin(\omega\pi y)
\end{equation*}
!et
on the unit square. This choice implies $f(x,y)=2\omega^2\pi^2 u(x,y)$.
With $\omega$ restricted to an integer
it follows that the boundary value is given by $\ub=0$.

We need to define the appropriate boundary conditions, the exact
solution, and the $f$ function in the code:

!bc pycod
def boundary(x, on_boundary):
    return on_boundary

bc = DirichletBC(V, Constant(0), boundary)

omega = 1.0
u_e = Expression('sin(omega*pi*x[0])*sin(omega*pi*x[1])',
                 omega=omega)

f = 2*pi**2*omega**2*u_e
!ec

=== Experiments ===

The function `convergence_rate_sin()` in `${prog["poisson_vc"]}.py`
implements the test problem
above and applies the `convergence_rate` function to estimate
convergence rates.
We achieve some interesting results.
Using the error measure `E5` based on the infinity norm of the
difference of the degrees of freedom, we have

|---c---------c---------c---------c---------c---------c-----|
| element | $n=8$   | $n=16$  | $n=32$  | $n=64$  | $n=128$ |
|---l---------r---------r---------r---------r---------r-----|
| P1      | 1.99    | 1.97    | 1.99    | 2.0     | 2.0     |
| P2      | 3.99    | 3.96    | 3.99    | 4.0     | 3.99    |
| P3      | 3.96    | 3.89    | 3.96    | 3.99    | 4.0     |
| P4      | 3.75    | 4.99    | 5.0     | 5.0     |         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|

An entry like 3.96 for $n=32$ and P3 means that we estimate the
a rate 3.96 by comparing two meshes, with resolutions $n=32$ and $n=16$,
using P3 elements. The coarsest mesh has $n=4$. The best estimates of
the rates appear in the right-most column.
[AL: Don't understand this table. What does each cell in the table
correspond to? I understand the elements, but what does for example $n
= 32$ mean? The rate needs two different meshes. Is the $n = 32$
column the difference with $n = 64$ or $n = 16$?]
[hpl: Inserted explanation, according to the shown code, but there
was a misleading argument `n` (list of resolutions) in the function
that was not used.]

The computations with $\mathsf{P}_4$ elements on a $2\times(128\times
128)$ mesh with a direct solver (UMFPACK) on a small laptop broke down
so these results have been left out of the table.  Otherwise we
achieve expected results: the error goes like $h^{d+1}$ for elements
of degree $d$. Also $L^2$ norms based on the `errornorm` gives the
expected $h^{d+1}$ rate for $u$ and $h^d$ for $\nabla u$.

However, using `(u_e - u)**2` for the error computation, with the same
degree for the interpolation of `u_e` as for `u`, results in $h^4$
convergence for P2 elements.

|---c---------c---------c---------c---------c---------c-----|
| element | $n=8$   | $n=16$  | $n=32$  | $n=64$  | $n=128$ |
|---l---------r---------r---------r---------r---------r-----|
| P1      | 1.98    | 1.94    | 1.98    | 2.0     | 2.0     |
| P2      | 3.98    | 3.95    | 3.99    | 3.99    | 3.99    |
| P3      | 3.69    | 4.03    | 4.01    | 3.95    | 2.77    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|

This is an example where it is important to interpolate `u_exact` to a
higher-order space (polynomials of degree 3 are sufficient here) to
avoid computing a too optimistic convergence rate.

# Problems with interpolate(u,Ve) - interpolate(u_exact,Ve) for
# high degree and large meshes. Rounding errors? errornorm is the
# remedy?
# interpolate(u,Ve) - interpolate(u_exact,Ve)
# P1: 1.98, 1.96, 1.99, 2.0, 2.0
# P2: 3.01, 3.03, 3.01, 3.0, 3.02
# P3: 2.7, 4.02, 4.0, 2.63, 0.17
# P4: 1.54, 5.11, 0.91, 0.15, -0.01

Checking convergence rates is the next best method for verifying PDE codes
(the best being a numerical solution without approximation errors
as in Section ref{ch:poisson0:verify1} and many other places in this tutorial).
