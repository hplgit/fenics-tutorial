======= The heat equation =======
label{ch:fundamentals:diffusion}

As a first extension of the Problem from the previous chapter, we
consider the time-dependent heat equation, or time-dependent diffusion
equation. This is the natural extension of the Poisson equation
describing the stationary distribution of heat in a body to a
time-dependent problem.

We will see that by discretizing time into small time intervals and
applying standard time-stepping methods, we can solve the heat
equation by solving a sequence of variational problems, much like the
one we encountered for the Poisson equation.

#The solution of
#nonlinear problems, as we showed in Section
#ref{ch:poisson0:nonlinear}, can also be automated (cf. Section
#ref{ftut:nonlinear:Newton:auto}), but many scientists will prefer to
#code the solution strategy of the nonlinear problem themselves and
#experiment with various combinations of strategies in difficult
#problems. Time-dependent problems are somewhat similar in this
#respect: we have to add a time discretization scheme, which is often
#quite simple, making it natural to explicitly code the details of the
#scheme so that the programmer has full control.
#We shall explain how
#easily this is accomplished through examples.

===== PDE problem =====

Our model problem for time-dependent PDEs reads

!bt
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f\hbox{ in }\Omega,
label{ch:diffusion0:pde1}\\
u &= \ub\hbox{ on } \partial \Omega,
label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:bc}\\
u &= u_0 \mbox{ at } t=0\tp
label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:ic}
\end{align}
!et
Here, $u$ varies with space and time, e.g., $u=u(x,y,t)$ if the spatial
domain $\Omega$ is two-dimensional. The source function $f$ and the
boundary values $\ub$ may also vary with space and time.
The initial condition $u_0$ is a function of space only.

===== Variational formulation =====
label{ftut:timedep:diffusion1}
idx{time-dependent PDEs}

A straightforward approach to solving time-dependent PDEs by the
finite element method is to first discretize the time derivative by a
finite difference approximation, which yields a recursive set of
stationary problems, and then turn each stationary problem into a
variational formulation.

Let superscript $n$ denote a quantity at time $t_n$, where $n$ is an
integer counting time levels. For example, $u^n$ means $u$ at time
level $n$. A finite difference discretization in time first consists
in sampling the PDE at some time level, say $n$:

!bt
\begin{equation} {\partial \over\partial t}u^k = \nabla^2 u^k + f^k\tp
label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:tk}
\end{equation}
!et
The time-derivative can be approximated by a finite difference.
For simplicity and stability reasons, we choose a
simple backward difference:

!bt
\begin{equation} {\partial \over\partial t}u^k\approx {u^n - u^{n-1}\over{\dt}},
label{ch:diffusion0:BE}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\dt$ is the time discretization parameter.
Inserting (ref{ch:diffusion0:BE}) in (ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1:tk}) yields

!bt
\begin{equation}
{u^n - u^{n-1}\over{\dt}} = \nabla^2 u^n + f^n\tp
label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:BE}
\end{equation}
!et
This is our time-discrete version of the diffusion PDE
(ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1}). This is a so-called *backward Euler* or
*implicit Euler* discretization. Alternatively, we may also view this
as a finite element discretization in time in the form of the first order
$\mathrm{dG}(0)$ method, which here is identical to the backward Euler
method.

We may reorder (ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1:BE}) so
that the left-hand side contains the terms with the unknown $u^n$ and
the right-hand side contains computed terms only. The result
is a recursive set of spatial
(stationary) problems for $u^n$ (assuming $u^{n-1}$ is known from
computations at the previous time level):

!bt
\begin{align}
u^0 &= u_0, label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:u0}\\
u^n - {\dt}\nabla^2 u^n &=  u^{n-1} + {\dt} f^n,\quad n=1,2,\ldots
label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:uk}
\end{align}
!et
Given $u_0$, we can solve for $u^0$, $u^1$, $u^2$, and so on.

An alternative to (ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1:uk}), which can be
convenient in implementations, is to collect
all terms on one side of the equality sign:

!bt
\begin{equation}
u^n - {\dt}\nabla^2 u^n -  u^{n-1} - {\dt} f^n = 0,\quad n=1,2,\ldots
label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:uk2}
\end{equation}
!et

We use a finite element method to solve
(ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1:u0}) and either of the equations
(ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1:uk}) or (ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1:uk2}).  This
requires turning the equations into weak forms.  As usual, we multiply
by a test function $v\in \hat V$ and integrate second-derivatives by
parts. Introducing the symbol $u$ for $u^n$ (which is natural in the
program), the resulting weak form arising from
formulation (ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1:uk})
can be conveniently written in
the standard notation:

!bt
\[ a(u,v)=L(v),\]
!et
where

!bt
\begin{align}
a(u,v) &= \int_\Omega\left( uv + {\dt}
\nabla u\cdot \nabla v\right) \dx, label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:a}\\
L(v) &= \int_\Omega \left(u^{n-1} + {\dt}  f^n\right)v \dx\tp
label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:L}
\end{align}
!et
The alternative form (ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1:uk2}) has an
abstract formulation

!bt
\[ F(u;v) = 0,\]
!et
where

!bt
\begin{equation}
F(u; v) = \int_\Omega\left( uv + {\dt}
\nabla u\cdot \nabla v -
(u^{n-1} + {\dt} f^n\right)v \dx\tp
label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:F}
\end{equation}
!et

In addition to the variational problem to be solve in each time step,
we also need to approximate the initial condition
(ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1:u0}). This equation can also be turned into a
variational problem:

!bt
\[ a_0(u,v)=L_0(v),\]
!et
with

!bt
\begin{align}
a_0(u,v) &= \int_\Omega uv \dx, label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:a0}\\
L_0(v) &= \int_\Omega u_0 v \dx\tp label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:L0}
\end{align}
!et
When solving this variational problem for $u^0$, $u^0$ becomes the
$L^2$ projection of the given initial value $u_0$ into the finite
element space. The alternative is to construct $u^0$ by just
interpolating the initial value $u_0$; that is,
if $u^0=\sum_{j=1}^N U^0_j\phi_j$, we simply set $U_j=u_0(x_j,y_j)$,
where $(x_j,y_j)$ are the coordinates of node number $j$. We refer to
these two strategies as computing the initial condition by either
projection or interpolation. Both operations are easy to
compute in FEniCS through one statement, using either the `project` or
`interpolate` function.

In summary, we thus need to solve the follow sequence of variational
problems to compute the finite element solution to the heat equation:
find $u^0\in V$ such that $a_0(u^0,v)=L_0(v)$ holds for all $v\in\hat V$,
and then find $u^n\in V$
such that $a(u^n,v)=L(v)$ for all $v\in\hat V$,
or alternatively, $F(u^n,v)=0$ for all $v\in\hat V$,
for $n=1,2,\ldots$.

===== A simple implementation =====
label{ftut:timedep:diffusion1:impl}

Our program needs to implement the time-stepping explicitly, but can
rely on FEniCS to easily compute $a_0$, $L_0$, $F$, $a$, and $L$, and solve
the linear systems for the unknowns.

=== Test problem ===

Just as for the Poisson problem from the previous chapter, we
construct a test problem that makes it easy to determine if the
calculations are correct. Since we know that our first-order
time-stepping scheme is exact for linear functions, we create a test
problem which has a linear variation in time. We combine this with a
quadratic variation in space. We thus take

!bt
\begin{equation} u = 1 + x^2 + \alpha y^2 + \beta t,
label{ch:diffusion0:pde1:u0test}
\end{equation}
!et
which yields a function whose computed values at the nodes will be
exact, regardless of the size of the elements and $\dt$, as long as
the mesh is uniformly partitioned. By inserting
(ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1:u0test}) into the heat equation
(ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1}), we find that the right-hand side $f$ must
be given by $f(x,y,t)=\beta - 2 - 2\alpha$. The boundary value
$\ub$ is $1 + x^2 + \alpha y^2 + \beta t$ and the initial
value $u_0$ is $1 + x^2 + \alpha y^2$.

idx{`${prog["diffusion_flat1"]}.py`}

=== FEniCS implementation ===

% if FORMAT == 'ipynb':
We first create a mesh:

!bc pycod
from __future__ import print_function
from fenics import *
import numpy as np

# Create mesh and define function space
nx = ny = 8
mesh = UnitSquareMesh(nx, ny)
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 1)
!ec
% endif

A new programming issue is how to deal with functions that vary in
space *and time*, such as the boundary condition $\ub(x, y,
t) = 1 + x^2 + \alpha y^2 + \beta t$. A natural solution is to use a
FEniCS `Expression` with time $t$ as a parameter, in addition to the
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$:

!bc pycod
% if FORMAT == 'ipynb':
# Create mesh and define function space
% endif
alpha = 3; beta = 1.2
u_b = Expression('1 + x[0]*x[0] + alpha*x[1]*x[1] + beta*t',
                 degree=2, alpha=alpha, beta=beta, t=0)
!ec
This function expression has the components of `x` as independent
variables, while `alpha`, `beta`, and `t` are parameters.  The
parameters can later be updated as in

!bc pycod-t
u_b.t = t
!ec

The essential boundary conditions, along the entire boundary in this case,
are set in the usual way:

!bc pycod
def boundary(x, on_boundary):
    return on_boundary

bc = DirichletBC(V, u0, boundary)
!ec

We shall use `u` for the unknown $u$ at the new time level and `u_p`
for $u$ at the previous time level. The initial value of `u_p` can be
computed by either projection or interpolation of $u_0$. Since we set
`t = 0` for the boundary value `u_b`, we can use this also to specify
the initial condition. We can then do

!bc pycod-t
u_p = project(u_b, V)
# or
u_p = interpolate(u_b, V)
!ec

!bc pyhid
u_p = interpolate(u_b, V)
!ec

!bwarning Projecting versus interpolating the initial condition
To actually recover the
exact solution (ref{ch:diffusion0:pde1:u0test}) to machine precision,
it is important not to compute the discrete initial condition by
projecting $u_0$, but by interpolating $u_0$ so that the degrees of freedom have
exact values at $t=0$ (projection results in approximative values at the
nodes).
!ewarning

We may either define $a$ or $L$ according to the formulas above, or
we may just define $F$ and ask FEniCS to figure out which terms that
go into the bilinear form $a$ and which that go into the linear form
$L$. The latter is convenient, especially in more complicated problems,
so we illustrate that construction:

!bc pycod
u = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
f = Constant(beta - 2 - 2*alpha)

F = u*v*dx + dt*dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx - (u_p + dt*f)*v*dx
a, L = lhs(F), rhs(F)
!ec

Finally, we perform the time-stepping in a loop:

!bc pycod
u = Function(V)
t = 0
for n in xrange(num_steps):
while t <= T:

    # Update current time
    t += dt
    u_b.t = t

    # Solve variational problem
    solve(a == L, u, bc)

% if FORMAT == 'ipynb':
    # Compute error
    u_e = interpolate(u_b, V)
    error = np.abs(u_e.vector().array() -
                   u.vector().array()).max()
    print('t = %.2f: error = %.3g' % (t, error))
% endif

    # Update previous solution
    u_p.assign(u)
!ec

In the last step of the time-stepping loop, we assign the values of
the variable `u` (the new computed solution) to the variable
containing the values at the previous time step. This must be done
using the `assign` member function. If we instead try to do `u_p = u`,
we will set the `u_p` Python variable to be the *same* variable as `u`
which is not what we want. (We need to variables, one for the values
at the previous time step and one for the values at the current time
step.)

!bwarning Remember to update expression objects with the current time!
Inside the time loop,
observe that `u0.t` must be updated before the `solve` statement
to enforce computation of Dirichlet conditions at the
current time level. (The Dirichlet conditions look up the `u0` object
for values.)
!ewarning

% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
The time loop above does not contain any comparison of the numerical
and the exact solution, which we must include in order to verify the
implementation.  As in the Poisson equation example in
Section ref{ch:poisson0:impl:dissect}, we compute the
difference between the array of nodal values of `u` and the array of
the interpolated exact solution. This may be done as follows:

!bc pycod
u_e = interpolate(u_b, V)
error = np.abs(u_e.vector().array() - u.vector().array()).max()
print('error, t=%.2f: %-10.3g' % (t, error))
!ec

The complete program code for this time-dependent case goes as follows:

===== Diffusion of a Gaussian function =====

=== The mathematical problem ===

Now we want to solve a more relevant test problem, namely the diffusion of
a Gaussian hill. It means that the initial value is given by

!bt
\[ u_0(x,y)= e^{-ax^2 - ay^2}\]
!et
on a domain $[-2,2]\times [2,2]$. We will take $a = 5$. For this
problem we will use homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions ($u = 0$).

=== FEniCS implementation ===

Which are the required changes to our previous program? One major
change is that domain is not a unit square anymore. We also want to
use much higher resolution. The new domain can
be created easily in FEniCS using `RectangleMesh`:

!bc pycod
nx = ny = 30
mesh = RectangleMesh(Point(-2,-2), Point(2,2), nx, ny)
!ec

We also need to redefine the initial condition and boundary condition.
Both are easily changed by defining a new `Expression` and by setting
$u = 0$ on the boundary. We will also save the solution to file in VTK
format in each time step:

!bc pycod
vtkfile << (u, t)
!ec

The complete program appears below.
