# We can go the other way around, i.e. dof->vertex ordering, too. The mapping is
# computed via dof_to_vertex_map

# This is again a list such that i-th degree of freedom is a point evaluation at
# d2v[i]-th vertex of the mesh. The usage is as follows
print all(near(u(coor[d2v[i]]), dof, 1E-10) for i, dof in enumerate(u_array))

# We can now tie the methods together and write our own compute_vertex_value
# function. The idea is to use u_array and the mapping:
print near(max(u_array[v2d] - u_at_vertices), 0)
# Note that we did not evaluate (expensive)! We simple reoreder the existing
# degrees of freeom (cheap).
