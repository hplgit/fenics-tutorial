The goal of this chapter is to demonstrate how a range of important
PDEs from science and engineering can be quickly solved with a few
lines of FEniCS code. We start with the heat equation and continue
with a nonlinear Poisson equation, the equations for linear
elasticity, the Navier--Stokes equations, and finally look at how to
solve systems of nonlinear advection--diffusion--reaction
equations. These problems illustrate how to solve time-dependent
problems, nonlinear problems, vector-valued problems, and systems of
PDE. For each problem, we derive the variational formulation and
express the problem in Python in a way that closely resembles the
mathematics.
