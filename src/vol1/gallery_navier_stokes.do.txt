======= The Navier--Stokes equations =======
label{ftut1:NS}

As our next example in this chapter, we will solve the incompressible
Navier--Stokes equations. This problem combines many of the challenges
from our previously studied problems: time-dependence, nonlinearity,
and vector-valued variables. We shall touch on a number of FEniCS topics,
many of them quite advanced. But you will see that even a relatively
complex algorithm such as a second-order splitting method for the
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, can be implemented with
relative ease in FEniCS.

#AL: This sounded very defensive... :-)
#so the exposition has the flavor of being
#a teaser of what can be easily achieved in FEniCS, while later
#chapters will dive into more detail with the most fundamental new
#topics touched upon here. Do not expect to understand every detail of
#this section -- the point is rather to show how a quite complex PDE
#problem is broken down to an implementation that still can be defended
#to be carried out in minutes rather than hours or days.

===== PDE problem =====

The incompressible Navier--Stokes equations are a system of equations
for the velocity $u$ and pressure $p$ in an incompressible fluid:

!bt
\begin{align}
  label{ftut1:ns:momentum}
  \varrho\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} +
  u \cdot \nabla u\right) &= \nabla\cdot\sigma(u, p) + f, \\
  label{ftut1:ns:continuity}
  \nabla \cdot u &= 0.
\end{align}
!et
The right-hand side $f$ is a given force per unit volume and
just as for the equations of linear elasticity,
$\sigma(u, p)$ denotes the stress tensor which for a Newtonian fluid
is given by

!bt
\begin{equation}
  \sigma(u, p) = 2\mu\epsilon(u) - pI,
\end{equation}
!et
where $\epsilon(u)$ is the strain-rate tensor

!bt
\[ \epsilon(u) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla u + (\nabla u)^T\right)\tp\]
!et
The parameter $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. Note that the momentum
equation (ref{ftut1:ns:momentum}) is very similar to the elasticity
equation (ref{ftut:elast:varform:equilibrium}). The difference is in the
two additional terms $\varrho(\partial u / \partial t + u \cdot \nabla u)$ and the different
expression for the stress tensor. The two extra terms express the
acceleration balanced by the force $F = \nabla\cdot\sigma + f$ per unit volume in Newton's second law of motion.

===== Variational formulation =====
label{ftut1:NS:varform}

The Navier--Stokes equations are different from
the time-dependent heat equation in that we need to solve a system of
equations and this system is of a special type. If we apply the same
technique as for the heat equation; that is, replacing the time
derivative with a simple difference quotient, we obtain a nonlinear
system of equations. This in
itself is not a problem for FEniCS as we saw in Section
ref{ftut1:gallery:nonlinearpoisson}, but the system has a so-called
*saddle point structure* and requires special techniques
(preconditioners and iterative methods) to be solved efficiently.

Instead, we will apply a simpler and often very efficient approach,
known as a *splitting method*. The idea is to
consider the two equations (ref{ftut1:ns:momentum}) and
(ref{ftut1:ns:continuity}) separately. There exist many splitting
strategies for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. One of the
oldest is the method proposed by Chorin cite{Chorin1968} and
Temam cite{Temam1969}, often referred to as *Chorin's method*. We will
use a modified version of Chorin's method, the so-called incremental
pressure correction scheme (IPCS) due to cite{Goda1979} which gives
improved accuracy compared to the original scheme at little extra
cost.

The IPCS scheme involves three steps. First, we compute a *tentative
velocity* $u^{\star}$ by advancing the momentum equation
(ref{ftut1:ns:momentum}) by a midpoint finite difference scheme in
time, but using the pressure $p^{n}$ from the
previous time interval. We will also linearize the nonlinear convective
term by using the known velocity $u^{n}$ from the previous time step:
$u^{n}\cdot\nabla u^{n}$.
The variational problem for this first step is:

!bt
\begin{align}
label{ftut1:ipcs1}
      &  \renni{v}{\varrho(u^{\star} - u^{n}) / \dt}
      + \renni{v}{\varrho u^{n} \cdot \nabla u^{n}}
      + \nonumber\\
      & \renni{\epsilon(v)}{\sigma(u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}, p^{n})}
      + \renni{v}{p^{n} n}_{\partial\Omega}
      - \nonumber\\
      &\renni{v}{\mu \nabla u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\cdot n}_{\partial\Omega}
      = \renni{v}{f^{n+1}}.
\end{align}
!et
This notation, suitable for problems with many terms in the variational
formulations, requires some explanation. First, we use the short-hand
notation

!bt
\[
  \inner{v}{w} = \int_{\Omega} vw \dx, \quad
  \inner{v}{w}_{\partial\Omega} = \int_{\partial\Omega} vw \ds.
\]
!et
This allows us to express the variational problem in a more compact
way. Second, we use the notation $u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}$. This notation
means the value of $u$ at the midpoint of the interval, usually approximated
by an arithmetic mean

!bt
\[
  u^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \approx (u^n + u^{n+1}) / 2.
\]
!et
Third, we notice that the variational problem (ref{ftut1:ipcs1})
arises from the integration by parts of the term
$\inner{-\nabla\cdot\sigma}{v}$. Just as for the elasticity problem in
Section ref{ftut:elast}, we obtain

!bt
\[
  \inner{-\nabla\cdot\sigma}{v}
  = \inner{\sigma}{\epsilon(v)}
  - \inner{T}{v}_{\partial\Omega},
\]
!et
where $T = \sigma\cdot n$ is the boundary traction. If we solve a
problem with a free boundary, we can take $T = 0$ on the
boundary. However, if we compute the flow through a channel or a pipe
and want to model flow that continues into an ``imaginary channel'' at
the outflow, we need to treat this term with some care. The assumption
we then make is that the derivative of the velocity in the direction
of the channel is zero at the outflow, corresponding to a flow that is
``fully developed'' or doesn't change significantly downstream of the
outflow. Doing so, the remaining boundary term at the outflow becomes
$pn - \mu\nabla u \cdot n$, which is the term appearing in the
variational problem (ref{ftut1:ipcs1}).

[hpl: Here a boundary term $(\mu n\cdot \nabla u^{n+\frac{1}{2}},v)$
is missing. This is the intricate discussions we had back in 2009-2010
with Harish on using N-S with $\nabla\cdot\sigma$ or $\nabla^2 u$.]

[AL: I think it looks correct as it is now, following the intricate discussion with Harish; one of the terms has been dropped to obtain the correct outflow profile and prevent creep around the corners.]

!bwarning `grad(u)` vs. `nabla_grad(u)`
For scalar functions $\nabla u$ has a clear meaning as the vector

!bt
\[ \nabla u =\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial y},
\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\right)\tp\]
!et
However, if $u$ is vector-valued, the meaning is less clear.
Some sources define $\nabla u$ as the matrix with elements
$\partial u_j / \partial x_i$, while other sources prefer
$\partial u_i / \partial x_j$. In FEniCS, `grad(u)` is defined as the
matrix with elements $\partial u_i / \partial x_j$, which is the
natural definition of $\nabla u$ if we think of this as the *gradient* or
*derivative* of $u$. This way, the matrix $\nabla u$ can be applied to
a differential $\dx$ to give an increment $\mathrm{d}u = \nabla u \,
\dx$. Since the alternative interpretation of $\nabla u$ as the matrix
with elements $\partial u_j / \partial x_i$ is very common, in
particular in continuum mechanics, FEniCS
provides the operator `nabla_grad` for this purpose.
For the Navier--Stokes equations, it is important to consider the
term $u \cdot \nabla u$ which should be interpreted as the vector
$w$ with elements
% if FORMAT == 'sphinx':
!bt
\[
w_i = \sum_j \left(u_j \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\right) u_i
= \sum_j u_j \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}\tp\]
!et
% else:
$w_i = \sum_j \left(u_j \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\right) u_i
     = \sum_j u_j \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}$.
% endif
This term can be implemented in FEniCS either as
`grad(u)*u`, since this is expression becomes
$\sum_j \partial u_i/\partial x_j u_j$, or as
`dot(u, nabla_grad(u))` since this expression becomes
$\sum_i u_i \partial u_j/\partial x_i$. We will use the notation
`dot(u, nabla_grad(u))` below since it corresponds more closely
to the standard notation $u \cdot \nabla u$.

To be more precise, there are three different notations used for PDEs
involving gradient, divergence, and curl operators.
One employs $\mathrm{grad}\, u$, $\mathrm{div}\, u$, and
$\mathrm{curl}\, u$ operators. Another employs $\nabla u$
as a synonym for $\mathrm{grad}\, u$, $\nabla\cdot u$ means $\mathrm{div}\, u$,
and $\nabla\times u$ is the name for $\mathrm{curl}\, u$. The
third operates with $\nabla u$, $\nabla\cdot u$, and $\nabla\times u$
in which $\nabla$ is a *vector* and, e.g., $\nabla u$ is a dyadic
expression: $(\nabla u)_{i,j} = \partial u_j/\partial x_i =
(\mathrm{grad}\,u)^{\top}$.
The latter notation, with $\nabla$ as a vector operator,
is often handy when deriving equations in continuum mechanics, and if
this interpretation of $\nabla$ is the foundation of your PDE, you must
use `nabla_grad`, `nabla_div`, and `nabla_curl` in FEniCS code as
these operators are compatible with dyadic computations.
From the Navier--Stokes equations we can easily see what $\nabla$ means:
if the convective term has the form $u\cdot \nabla u$ (actually meaning
$(u\cdot\nabla) u$), $\nabla$ is a vector operator, reading
`dot(u, nabla_grad(u))` in FEniCS, but if we see
$\nabla u\cdot u$ or $(\mathrm{grad} u)\cdot u$, the
corresponding FEniCS
expression is `dot(grad(u), u)`.
!ewarning

We now move on to the second step in our splitting scheme for the
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. In the first step, we computed
the tentative velocity $u^{\star}$ based on the pressure from the
previous time step. We may now use the computed tentative velocity to
compute the new pressure $p^n$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{ftut1:ipcs2}
  \renni{\nabla q}{\nabla p^{n+1}}
  = \renni{\nabla q}{\nabla p^{n}} - \dt^{-1}\renni{q}{\nabla \cdot u^{\star}}.
\end{equation}
!et
Note here that $q$ is a scalar-valued test function from the pressure
space, whereas the test function $v$ in (ref{ftut1:ipcs1}) is a
vector-valued test function from the velocity space.

One way to think about this step is to subtract the Navier--Stokes
momentum equation (ref{ftut1:ns:momentum}) expressed in terms of the
tentative velocity $u^{\star}$ and the pressure $p^{n}$ from the
momentum equation expressed in terms of the velocity $u^n$ and
pressure $p^n$. This results in the equation

!bt
\begin{equation} \label{ftut1:ipcs:step}
  (u^n - u^{\star}) / \dt + \nabla p^{n+1} - \nabla p^n = 0.
\end{equation}
!et
Taking the divergence and requiring that $\nabla \cdot u^n = 0$ by the
Navier--Stokes continuity equation (ref{ftut1:ns:continuity}), we
obtain the equation $-\nabla\cdot u^{\star} / \dt + \nabla^2 p^{n+1} -
\nabla^2 p^n = 0$, which is a Poisson problem for the pressure $p^{n+1}$
resulting in the variational problem (ref{ftut1:ipcs2}).

Finally, we compute the corrected velocity $u^{n+1}$ from the equation
(ref{ftut1:ipcs:step}). Multiplying this equation by a test function
$v$, we obtain

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{ftut1:ipcs3}
  \renni{v}{u^{n+1}} =
  \renni{v}{u^{\star}} - \dt\renni{v}{\nabla(p^{n+1}-p^{n})}.
\end{equation}
!et

In summary, we may thus solve the incompressible Navier--Stokes
equations efficiently by solving a sequence of three linear variational
problems in each time step.

===== FEniCS implementation =====

=== Test problem 1: Channel flow ===

As a first test problem, we compute the flow between two infinite plates,
so-called channel or Poiseuille flow, since this problem has a known
analytical solution. Let $H$ be the distance between the plates and $L$
the length of the channel. There are no body forces.

We may scale the problem first to get rid of seemingly independent
physical parameters. The physics of this problem is governed by
viscous effects only, in the direction perpendicular to the flow, so a
time scale should be based on diffusion accross the channel: $t_c =
H^2/\nu$. We let $U$, some characteristic inflow velocity, be the
velocity scale and $H$ the spatial scale. The pressure scale is taken
as the characteristic shear stress, $\mu U/H$, since this is a primary
example of shear flow.  Inserting $\bar x = x/H$, $\bar y = y/H$,
$\bar z = z/H$, $\bar u =u/U$, $\bar p = Hp/(\mu U)$, and $\bar t =
H^2/\nu$ in the equations results in the scaled Navier--Stokes
equations (dropping bars after the scaling):

[AL: This looks very strange to me. Why don't we get the standard scaled version of NS? And why is $\mu$ still in there? And last term should be dropped since it is actually zero, just seems confusing.]

!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \mathrm{Re}\, u\cdot\nabla u
&= -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2 u + \mu\nabla(\nabla\cdot u),\\
\nabla\cdot u &= 0\tp
\end{align*}
!et
Here, $\mathrm{Re} = \varrho UH/\mu$ is the Reynolds number. Because
of the time and pressure scale, which are different from
convection-dominated fluid flow, the Reynolds number is associated
with the convective term and not the viscosity term. Note that the
last term in the first equation is zero, but we included this term as
it arises naturally from the original $\nabla\cdot\sigma$ term.

[AL: How can we conclude that $\partial p / \partial x = $ constant?]

The exact solution is derived by assuming $u=(u_x(x,y,z),0,0)$, with
the $x$ axis pointing along the channel. Since $\nabla\cdot u=0$, $u$
cannot depend on $x$. The physics of channel flow is also
two-dimensional so we can omit the $z$ coordinate (more precisely:
$\partial/\partial z=0$). Inserting $u=(u_x,0,0)$ in the (scaled)
governing equations gives $u_x''(y) = \partial p/\partial x$.
Differentiating this equation with respect to $x$ shows that $\partial
p/\partial x$ is a constant, here called $-\beta$. This is the driving
force of the flow and can be specified as a known parameter in the
problem.  Integrating $u_x''(y)=-\beta$ over the width of the channel,
$[0,1]$, and requiring $u=0$ at the channel walls, results in
$u_x=\frac{1}{2}\beta y(1-y)$. The characteristic inlet flow in the
channel, $U$, can be taken as the maximum inflow at $y=1/2$, implying
that $\beta = 8$. The length of the channel, $L/H$ in the scaled
model, has no impact on the result, so for simplicity we just compute
on the unit square. Mathematically, the pressure must be prescribed
at a point, but since $p$ does not depend on $y$, we can set $p$ to a
known value, e.g. zero, along the outlet boundary $x=1$. The result
is $p(x)=8(1-x)$ and $u_x=4y(1-y)$.

The boundary conditions can be set as $p=1$ at $x=0$, $p=0$ at $x=1$
and $u=0$ on the walls $y=0,1$. This defines the pressure drop and
should result in unit maximum velocity at the inlet and outlet and a
parabolic velocity profile without further specifications.  Note that
it is only meaningful to solve the Navier--Stokes equations in 2D or 3D
geometries, although the underlying mathematical problem collapses to
two 1D problems, one for $u_x(y)$ and one for $p(x)$.

The scaled model is not so easy to simulate using a standard
Navier--Stokes solver with dimensions. However, one can argue that the
convection term is zero, so the Re coefficient in front of this term
in the scaled PDEs is not important and can be set to unity. In that
case, setting $\varrho = \mu = 1$ in the original Navier--Stokes equations
resembles the scaled model.

[AL: One could ask why the scaling is important at all here? It is interesting to discuss for physics and analysis, but don't we always want to implement a solver using units so that one can insert specific material parameters?]

=== FEniCS implementation ===

Our previous examples have all started out with the creation of a
mesh and then the definition of a `FunctionSpace` on the mesh. For the
splitting scheme we will use to solve the Navier--Stokes equations we
need to define two function spaces, one for the velocity and one for
the pressure:

!bc pycod
V = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 2)
Q = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 1)
!ec
The first space `V` is a vector-valued function space for the velocity
and the second space `Q` is a scalar-valued function space for the
pressure. We use piecewise quadratic elements for the velocity and
piecewise linear elements for the pressure. When creating a
`VectorFunctionSpace` in FEniCS, the value-dimension (the length of
the vectors) will be set equal to the geometric dimension of the
finite element mesh. One can easily create vector-valued function
spaces with other dimensions in FEniCS by adding the keyword parameter
`dim`:

!bc pycod
V = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 2, dim=10)
!ec

!bnotice Stable finite element spaces for the Navier--Stokes equations
It is well-known that certain finite element spaces are not *stable*
for the Navier--Stokes equations, or even for the simpler Stokes
equations. The prime example of an unstable pair of finite element
spaces is to use first degree continuous piecewise polynomials for both the
velocity and the pressure. Using an
unstable pair of spaces typically results in a solution with
*spurious* (unwanted, non-physical) oscillations in the pressure
solution. The simple remedy is to use piecewise continuous piecewise
quadratic elements for the velocity and continuous piecewise linear
elements for the pressure. Together, these elements form the so-called
*Taylor-Hood* element. Spurious oscillations may occur also for
splitting methods if an unstable element pair is used.
!enotice

Since we have two different function spaces, we need to create two sets
of trial and test functions:

!bc pycod
u = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
p = TrialFunction(Q)
q = TestFunction(Q)
!ec

idx{`near`}

As we have seen in previous examples, boundaries may be defined in
FEniCS by defining Python functions that return `True` or `False`
depending on whether a point should be considered part of the
boundary, for example

!bc pycod
def boundary(x, on_boundary):
    return near(x[0], 0)
!ec
This function defines the boundary to be all points with
$x$-coordinate equal to (near) zero. The `near` function comes from
FEniCS and performs a test with tolerance: `abs(x[0]-0) < 3E-16` so
we do not run into rounding troubles.
Alternatively, we may give the boundary
definition as a string of C++ code, much like we have previously
defined expressions such as `u0 = Expression('1 + x[0]*x[0] +
2*x[1]*x[1]')`. The above definition of the boundary in terms of a
Python function may thus be replaced by a simple C++ string:

!bc pycod
boundary = 'near(x[0], 0)'
!ec
This has the advantage of moving the computation of which nodes
belong to the boundary from Python to C++, which improves the efficiency
of the program.

For the current example, we will set three different boundary
conditions. First, we will set $u = 0$ at the walls of the channel;
that is, at $y = 0$ and $y = 1$. Second, we will set $p = 1$ at the
inflow ($x = 0$) and, finally, $p = 0$ at the outflow ($x = 1$). This
will result in a pressure gradient that will accelerate the flow from an
initial stationary state. These
boundary conditions may be defined as follows:

!bc pycod
# Define boundaries
inflow   = 'near(x[0], 0)'
outflow  = 'near(x[0], 1)'
walls    = 'near(x[1], 0) || near(x[1], 1)'

# Define boundary conditions
bcu_noslip  = DirichletBC(V, Constant((0, 0)), walls)
bcp_inflow  = DirichletBC(Q, Constant(8), inflow)
bcp_outflow = DirichletBC(Q, Constant(0), outflow)
bcu = [bcu_noslip]
bcp = [bcp_inflow, bcp_outflow]
!ec

At the end, we collect the boundary conditions for the velocity and
pressure in Python lists so we can easily access them in the
following computation.

We now move on to the definition of the variational forms. There are
three variational problems to be defined, one for each step in the
IPCS scheme. Let us look at the definition of the first variational
problem. We start with some constants:

@@@CODE src/navier_stokes_channel.py fromto: U\s+= 0\.5@# Define strain-rate tensor
The next step is to set up the variational form for the first step
(ref{ftut1:ipcs1}) in the solution process.
Since the variational problem contains a mix of
known and unknown quantities we have introduced a naming convention to
be used throughout the book: `u` is the unknown (mathematically $u^{n+1}$)
as a trial function in the variational form, `u_` is the most recently
computed approximation ($u^{n+1}$ available as a finite element
FEniCS `Function` object), `u_n` is $u^n$, and the same convention
goes for `p`, `p_` ($p^{n+1}$), and `p_n` ($p^n$).

@@@CODE src/navier_stokes_channel.py fromto: def epsilon@# Define variational problem for step 2
Note that we, in the definition of the variational problem,
take advantage of the
Python programming language to define our own operators `sigma` and
`epsilon`. Using Python this way makes it easy to extend the
mathematical language of FEniCS with special operators and
constitutive laws.

Also note that FEniCS can sort out the bilinear form $a(u,v)$ and
linear form $L(v)$ forms by the `lhs`
and `rhs` functions. This is particularly convenient in longer and
more complicated variational forms.

The splitting scheme requires the solution of a sequence of three
variational problems in each time step. We have previously used the
built-in FEniCS function `solve` to solve variational problems. Under
the hood, when a user calls `solve(a == L, u, bc)`, FEniCS will
perform the following steps:

!bc pycod
A = assemble(A)
b = assemble(L)
bc.apply(A, b)
solve(A, u.vector(), b)
!ec
In the last step, FEniCS uses the overloaded `solve` function to solve
the linear system `AU = b` where `U` is the vector of degrees of
freedom for the function $u(x) = \sum_{j=1} U_j \phi_j(x)$.

In our implementation of the splitting scheme, we will make use of
these low-level commands to first assemble and then call solve. This
has the advantage that we may control when we assemble and when we
solve the linear system. In particular, since the matrices for the
three variational problems are all time-independent, it makes sense to
assemble them once and for all outside of the time-stepping loop:

!bc pycod
A1 = assemble(a1)
A2 = assemble(a2)
A3 = assemble(a3)
!ec
Within the time-stepping loop, we may then assemble only the
right-hand side vectors, apply boundary conditions, and call the solve
function as here for the first of the three steps:

!bc pycod
# Time-stepping
t = 0
for n in range(num_steps):

    # Update current time
    t += dt

    # Step 1: Tentative velocity step
    b1 = assemble(L1)
    [bc.apply(b1) for bc in bcu]
    solve(A1, u_.vector(), b1)
!ec
Notice the Python *list comprehension* `[bc.apply(b1) for bc in bcu]`
which iterates over all `bc` in the list `bcu`. This is a convenient
and compact way to construct a loop that applies
all boundary conditions in a single line. Also, the code works if
we add more Dirichlet boundary conditions in the future.

Finally, let us look at an important detail in how we use parameters
such as the time step `dt` in the definition of our variational
problems. Since we might want to change these later, for example if we
want to experiment with smaller or larger time steps, we wrap these
using a FEniCS `Constant`:

!bc pycod
k = Constant(dt)
!ec
The assembly of matrices and vectors in FEniCS is based on code
generation. This means that whenever we change a variational problem,
FEniCS will have to generate new code, which may take a little
time. New code will also be generated when a float value for the time
step is changed. By wrapping this parameter using
`Constant`, FEniCS will treat the parameter as a generic constant and
not a specific numerical value, which prevents repeated code
generation. In the case of the time step, we choose a new name `k`
instead of `dt` for the `Constant` since we also want to use the
variable `dt` as a Python float as part of the time-stepping.

The complete code for simulating 2D channel flow with FEniCS looks as
follows:

@@@CODE src/navier_stokes_channel.py fromto: from fenics import@

=== Verification ===

We compute the error at the nodes as we have done before to verify
that our implementation is correct. Our Navier--Stokes solver computes
the solution to the time-dependent incompressible Navier--Stokes
equations, starting from the initial condition $u = (0, 0)$. We have
not specified the initial condition explicitly in our solver which
means that FEniCS will initialize all variables, in particular the
previous and current velocities `u_n` and `u_`, to zero. Since the
exact solution is quadratic, we expect the solution to be exact to
within machine precision at the nodes at infinite time. For our
implementation, the error quickly approaches zero and is approximately
$10^{-6}$ at time $T = 10$.

===== Exercise: Simulate channel flow in a 3D geometry =====

FEniCS solvers typically have the number of space dimensions
parameterized, so a 1D, 2D, and 3D code all look the same.
We shall demonstrate what this means by extending the 2D solver
`navier_stokes_channel.py` to a simulator where the domain is a box
(the unit cube in the scaled model).

!bsubex
Set up boundary conditions for $u$ at all points on the boundary.
Set up boundary conditions for $p$ at all points on the boundary as
this is required by our Poisson equation for $p$ (but not in the
original mathematical model -- there, knowing $p$ at one point throughout
time is sufficient).

!bsol
At the inlet $x=0$ we have the velocity completely described: $(u_x,0,0)$.
At the channel walls, $y=0$ and $y=1$, we also have the velocity
completely described: $u=(0,0,0)$ because of no-slip.
At the outlet x=1 we do not specify anything. This means that the
boundary integrals in Step 1 vanish and that $p=0$ and
$\partial u/\partial n = 0$, with $n$ as the $x$ direction,
implying ``no change'' with $x$, which is reasonable (since we know
that $\partial/\partial x=0$ because of incompressibility).
For the pressure we set $p=8$ at $x=0$ and $p=0$ at $x=1$ to
represent a scaled pressure gradient equal to 8 (which leads to
a unit maximum velocity). At $y=0$ and $y=1$ we do not specify anything,
which implies $\partial p/\partial y=0$. This is a condition much
discussed in the literature, but it works perfectly in channel flow
with straight walls.

The two remaining boundaries, $z=0$ and $z=1$, requires attention.
For the pressure, ``nothing happens'' in the $z$ direction so
$\partial p/\partial z=\partial p/\partial n=0$ is the condition.
This is automatically implemented by the finite element method.
For the velocity we also have a ``nothing happens'' criterion in the
3rd direction, and we can in addition use the assumption of $u_z=0$,
if needed.
The derivative criterion means $\partial u/\partial z=\partial u/\partial n=0$
in the boundary integrals. There is also an integral involving $pn_z$
in a component PDE with $u_z$ in all terms.

We must switch the domain from `UnitSquareMesh` to `UnitCubeMesh`.
We must also switch all 3-vectors to 2-vectors, such as
replacing going from `(0,0)` to `(0,0,0)` in `bcu_noslip`. Similarly,
`f` and `u_e` must extend their 2-vectors to 3-vectors.

===== Flow past a cylinder =====

We now turn our attention to a more challenging physical example: flow
past a circular cylinder. The geometry and parameters are taken from
problem DFG 2D-2 in the "FEATFLOW/1995-DFG benchmark suite":
"http://www.featflow.de/en/benchmarks/cfdbenchmarking/flow/dfg_benchmark2_re100.html"
and is illustrated in Figure
ref{ftut1:navier_stokes_cylinder:geometry}. The kinematic viscosity is
given by $\nu = 0.001 = \mu/\varrho$ and the inflow velocity profile is
specified as

[AL: Footnote for featflow does not fit page.]

!bt
\[
  u(x, y, t) = \left(1.5 \cdot \frac{4y(1-y)}{0.41^2}, 0\right),
\]
!et
which has a maximum magnitude of $1.5$ at $y = 0.41/2$. We do not
scale anything in this benchmark since exact parameters in the case
we want to simulate are known.

=== FEniCS implementation ===

So far all our domains have been simple shapes such as a unit square or
a rectangular box. A number of such simple meshes may be created in
FEniCS using the built-in meshes
(`UnitIntervalMesh`,
`UnitSquareMesh`,
`UnitCubeMesh`,
`IntervalMesh`,
`RectangleMesh`, and
`BoxMesh`).
FEniCS supports the creation of more complex meshes via a technique
called *constructive solid geometry* (CSG), which lets us define
geometries in terms of simple shapes (primitives) and set operations:
union, intersection, and set difference. The set operations are
encoded in FEniCS using the operators `+` (union), `*` (intersection),
and `-` (set difference). To access the CSG functionality in FEniCS,
one must import the FEniCS module `mshr` which provides the
extended meshing functionality of FEniCS.

The geometry for the cylinder flow test problem can be defined easily
by first defining the rectangular channel and then subtracting the
circle:

!bc pycod
channel = Rectangle(Point(0, 0), Point(2.2, 0.41))
cylinder = Circle(Point(0.2, 0.2), 0.05)
geometry = channel - cylinder
!ec
We may then create the mesh by calling the function `generate_mesh`:

!bc pycod
mesh = generate_mesh(geometry, 64)
!ec

To solve the cylinder test problem, we only need to make a few minor
changes to the code we wrote for the Poiseuille flow test
case. Besides defining the new mesh, the only change we need to make
is to modify the boundary conditions and the time step size. The
boundaries are specified as follows:

!bc pycod
inflow   = 'near(x[0], 0)'
outflow  = 'near(x[0], 2.2)'
walls    = 'near(x[1], 0) || near(x[1], 0.41)'
cylinder = 'on_boundary && x[0]>0.1 && x[0]<0.3 && x[1]>0.1 && x[1]<0.3'
!ec
The last line may seem cryptic before you catch the idea: we want to pick
out all boundary points (`on_boundary`) that also lie within the 2D
domain $[0.1,0.3]\times [0.1,0.3]$, see Figure ref{ftut1:navier_stokes_cylinder:geometry}. The only possible points are then the points on the
circular boundary!

idx{`set_log_level`}
idx{`DEBUG` log level}
idx{`PROGRESS` log level}

In addition to these essential changes, we will make a number of small
changes to improve our solver. First, since we need to choose a
relatively small time step to compute the solution (a time step that
is too large will make the solution blow up) we add a progress bar so
that we can follow the progress of our computation. This can be done
as follows:

!bc pycod
progress = Progress('Time-stepping')
set_log_level(PROGRESS)

t = 0.0
for n in range(num_steps):

    # Update current time
    t += dt

    # Place computation here

    # Update progress bar
    progress.update(t / T)
!ec

!bnotice Log levels and printing in FEniCS
Notice the call to `set_log_level(PROGRESS)` which is essential to
make FEniCS actually display the progress bar. FEniCS is actually
quite informative about what is going on during a computation but the
amount of information printed to screen depends on the current log
level. Only messages with a priority higher than or equal to the
current log level will be displayed. The predefined log levels in
FEniCS are
`DBG`,
`TRACE`,
`PROGRESS`,
`INFO`,
`WARNING`,
`ERROR`, and
`CRITICAL`. By default, the log level is set to `INFO` which means
that messages at level `DBG`, `TRACE`, and `PROGRESS` will not be
printed. Users may print messages using the FEniCS functions `info`,
`warning`, and `error` which will print messages at the obvious log
level (and in the case of `error` also throw an exception and
exit). One may also use the call `log(level, message)` to print a
message at a specific log level.
!enotice

Since the system(s) of linear equations are significantly larger than
for the simple Poiseuille flow test problem, we choose to use an
iterative method instead of the default direct (sparse) solver used by
FEniCS when calling `solve`. Efficient solution of linear systems
arising from the discretization of PDEs requires the choice of both a
good iterative (Krylov subspace) method and a good
preconditioner. For this problem, we will simply use the biconjugate
gradient stabilized method (BiCGSTAB). This can be done by adding the
keyword `bicgstab` in the call to `solve`. We also add a preconditioner,
`ilu` to further speed up the computations:

!bc pycod
solve(A1, u1.vector(), b1, 'bicgstab', 'ilu')
solve(A2, p1.vector(), b2, 'bicgstab', 'ilu')
solve(A3, u1.vector(), b3, 'bicgstab')
!ec

Finally, to be able to postprocess the computed solution in Paraview,
we store the solution to file in each time step. To avoid cluttering
our working directory with a large number of solution
files, we make sure to store the solution in a subdirectory:

!bc pycod
vtkfile_u = File('navier_stokes_cylinder/velocity.pvd')
vtkfile_p = File('navier_stokes_cylinder/pressure.pvd')
!ec
Note that one does not need to create the directory before running the
program. It will be created automatically by FEniCS.

We also store the solution using a FEniCS `TimeSeries`. This allows us
to store the solution not for visualization (as when using VTK
files), but for later reuse in a computation as we will see in the
next section. Using a `TimeSeries` it is easy and efficient to read in
solutions from certain points in time during a simulation. The
`TimeSeries` class uses a binary HDF5 file for efficient storage and
access to data.

Figures ref{ftut1:fig:navier_stokes_cylinder:velocity} and
ref{ftut1:fig:navier_stokes_cylinder:pressure} show the velocity and
pressure at final time visualized in Paraview. For the visualization
of the velocity, we have used the _Glyph_ filter to visualize the
vector velocity field. For the visualization of the pressure, we have
used the _Warp By Scalar_ filter.
