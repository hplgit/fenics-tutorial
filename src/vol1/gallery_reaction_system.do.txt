======= A system of advection--diffusion--reaction equations =======
label{ftut1:reactionsystem}

The problems we have encountered so far---with the notable exception
of the Navier--Stokes equations---all share a common feature: they all
involve models expressed by a *single* scalar or vector PDE. In many
situations the model is instead expressed as a system of PDEs,
describing different quantities and with possibly (very) different
physics.  As we saw for the Navier--Stokes equations, one way to solve
a system of PDEs in FEniCS is to use a splitting method where we solve
one equation at a time and feed the solution from one equation into
the next. However, one of the strengths with FEniCS is the ease by
which one can instead define variational problems that couple several
PDEs into one compound system. In this section, we will look at how to use
FEniCS to write solvers for such systems of coupled PDEs.
The goal is to demonstrate how easy it is to implement fully implicit,
also known as monolithic, solvers in FEniCS.

===== PDE problem =====

Our model problem is the following system of
advection--diffusion--reaction equations:

!bt
\begin{align}
  label{ftut1:reactionsystem:system:1}
  \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial t} +
  w \cdot \nabla u_1 - \nabla\cdot(\epsilon\nabla u_1)
    &= f_1 -K u_1 u_2, \\
  label{ftut1:reactionsystem:system:2}
  \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial t} +
  w \cdot \nabla u_2 - \nabla\cdot(\epsilon\nabla u_2)
    &= f_2 -K u_1 u_2, \\
  label{ftut1:reactionsystem:system:3}
  \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial t} +
  w \cdot \nabla u_3 - \nabla\cdot(\epsilon\nabla u_3)
    &= f_3 + K u_1 u_2 - K u_3.
\end{align}
!et

This system models the chemical reaction between two species $A$ and
$B$ in some domain $\Omega$:

!bt
\[
  A + B \rightarrow C.
\]
!et

We assume that the equation is *first-order*, meaning that the
reaction rate is proportional to the concentrations $[A]$ and $[B]$ of
the two species $A$ and $B$:

!bt
\[
  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} [C] = K [A] [B].
\]
!et
We also assume that the formed species $C$ spontaneously decays with a
rate proportional to the concentration $[C]$. In the PDE system
(ref{ftut1:reactionsystem:system:1})--(ref{ftut1:reactionsystem:system:3}),
we use the variables $u_1$, $u_2$, and $u_3$ to denote the
concentrations of the three species:

!bt
\[
  u_1 = [A], \quad u_2 = [B], \quad u_3 = [C].
\]
!et
We see that the chemical reactions are accounted for in the
right-hand sides of the PDE system (ref{ftut1:reactionsystem:system:1})--(ref{ftut1:reactionsystem:system:3}).

The chemical reactions take part at each point in the domain
$\Omega$. In addition, we assume that the species $A$, $B$, and $C$
diffuse throughout the domain with diffusivity $\epsilon$ (the terms
$-\nabla\cdot(\epsilon\nabla u_i)$) and are advected with velocity
$w$ (terms like $w\cdot\nabla u_i$).

To make things visually and physically interesting, we shall let the
chemical reaction take place in the velocity field computed from the
solution of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations around a
cylinder from the previous section.  In summary, we will thus be
solving the following coupled system of nonlinear PDEs:

!bt
\begin{align}
  label{ftut1:reactionsystem:full}
  \varrho\left(\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} +
  w \cdot \nabla w\right) &= \nabla\cdot\sigma(w, p) + f, \\
  \nabla \cdot w &= 0, \\
  \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial t} +
  w \cdot \nabla u_1 - \nabla\cdot(\epsilon\nabla u_1)
    &= f_1 - K u_1 u_2, \\
  \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial t} +
  w \cdot \nabla u_2 - \nabla\cdot(\epsilon\nabla u_2)
    &= f_2 - K u_1 u_2, \\
  \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial t} +
  w \cdot \nabla u_3 - \nabla\cdot(\epsilon\nabla u_3)
    &= f_3 + K u_1 u_2 - K u_3.
\end{align}
!et
We assume that $u_1 = u_2 = u_3 = 0$ at $t = 0$ and inject the species
$A$ and $B$ into the system by specifying nonzero source terms $f_1$
and $f_2$ close to the corners at the inflow, and take $f_3 = 0$. The
result will be that $A$ and $B$ are convected by advection and
diffusion throughout the channel, and when they mix the species $C$
will be formed.

Since the system is one-way coupled from the Navier--Stokes subsystem
to the advection--diffusion--reaction subsystem, we do not need to
recompute the solution to the Navier--Stokes equations, but can just
read back the previously computed velocity field $w$ and feed it into
our equations. But we *do* need to learn how to read and write
solutions from time-dependent PDE problems.

===== Variational formulation =====

We obtain the variational formulation of our system by multiplying
each equation by a test function, integrating the second-order terms
$-\nabla\cdot(\epsilon\nabla u_i)$ by parts, and summing up the
equations. When working with FEniCS it is convenient to think of the
PDE system as a vector of equations. The test functions are collected in
a vector too, and the variational formulation is the inner product of
the vector PDE and the vector test function.

We also need introduce some discretization in time. We will use the
backward Euler method as before when we solved the heat equation and
approximate the time derivatives by $(u_i^{n+1}-u_i^n) / \dt$. Let
$v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$ be the test functions, or the components of
the test vector function. The inner product results in

!bt
\begin{align}
  label{ftu1:reactionsystem:varproblem}
  & \int_{\Omega}
  (\dt^{-1} (u_1^{n+1} - u_1^n) v_1 + w \cdot \nabla u^{n+1}_1 \, v_1
  + \epsilon \nabla u^{n+1}_1 \cdot \nabla v_1) \dx \\
  + & \int_{\Omega} (\dt^{-1} (u_2^{n+1} - u_2^n) v_2
  + w \cdot \nabla u^{n+1}_2 \, v_2
  + \epsilon \nabla u^{n+1}_2 \cdot \nabla v_2) \dx \\
  + & \int_{\Omega} (\dt^{-1} (u_3^{n+1} - u_3^n) v_3
  + w \cdot \nabla u^{n+1}_3 \, v_3
  + \epsilon \nabla u^{n+1}_3 \cdot \nabla v_3) \dx \\
  - & \int_{\Omega} (f_1 v_1 + f_2 v_2 + f_3 v_3) \dx \\
  - & \int_{\Omega} (-K u^{n+1}_1 u^{n+1}_2 v_1 - K u^{n+1}_1
  u^{n+1}_2 v_2 + K u^{n+1}_1 u^{n+1}_2 v_3 - K u^{n+1}_3 v_3) \dx = 0.
\end{align}
!et
For this problem it is natural to assume homogeneous Neumann boundary
conditions on the entire boundary for $u_1$, $u_2$, and $u_3$; that
is, $\partial u_i/\partial n = 0$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$. This means that
the boundary terms vanish when we integrate by parts.

===== FEniCS implementation =====

The first step is to read the mesh from file. Luckily, we made sure to
save the mesh to file in the Navier--Stokes example and can now easily
read it back from file:

!bc pycod
mesh = Mesh(cylinder.xml.gz')
!ec
The mesh is stored in the native FEniCS XML format (with additional
gzipping to decrease the file size).

Next, we need to define the finite element function space. For this
problem, we need to define several spaces. The first space we create
is the space for the velocity field $w$ from the Navier--Stokes
simulation. We call this space $W$ and define the space by

!bc pycod
W = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 2)
!ec
It is important that this space is exactly the same as the space we
used for the velocity field in the Navier--Stokes solver. To read the
values for the velocity field, we use a `TimeSeries`:

!bc pycod
timeseries_w = TimeSeries('navier_stokes_cylinder/velocity')
!ec
This will initialize the object `timeseries_w` which we will call
later in the time-stepping loop to retrieve values from the
file `velocity.h5` (in binary HDF5 format).

For the three concentrations $u_1$, $u_2$, and $u_3$, we want to
create a *mixed space* with functions that represent the full system
$(u_1, u_2, u_3)$ as a single entity. To do this, we need to define a
`MixedElement` as the product space of three simple finite elements
and then used the mixed element to define the function space:

!bc pycod
P1 = FiniteElement('P', 'triangle', 1)
element = MixedElement([P1, P1, P1])
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, element)
!ec

!bwarning Mixed elements as products of elements
FEniCS also allows finite elements to be defined as products of simple
elements (or mixed elements). For example, the well-known Taylor--Hood
element, with quadratic velocity components and linear pressure functions,
may be defined as follows:

!bc pycod
P2 = VectorElement('P', 'triangle', 2)
P1 = FiniteElement('P', 'triangle', 1)
TH = P2 * P1
!ec
This syntax works great for two elements, but for three or more
elements we meet a subtle issue in how the Python interpreter handles
the `*` operator. For the reaction system, we create the mixed element
by `element = MixedElement([P1, P1, P1])` and one would be tempted to
write

!bc pycod
element = P1 * P1 * P1
!ec
However, this is equivalent to writing `element = (P1 * P1) * P1` so
the result will be a mixed element consisting of two subsystems, the
first of which in turn consists of two scalar subsystems.

Finally, we remark that for the simple case of a mixed system
consisting of three scalar elements as for the reaction system, the
definition is in fact equivalent to using a standard vector-valued
element:

!bc pycod
element = VectorElement('P', 'triangle', 1, dim=3)
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, element)
!ec
!ewarning

Once the space has been created, we need to define our test functions
and finite element functions. Test functions for a mixed function
space can be created by replacing `TestFunction` by `TestFunctions`:

!bc pycod
v_1, v_2, v_3 = TestFunctions(V)
!ec

Since the problem is nonlinear, we need to work with functions rather
than trial functions for the unknowns. This can be done by using the
corresponding `Functions` construction in FEniCS. However, as we will
need to access the `Function` for the entire system itself, we first
need to create that function and then access its components:

!bc pycod
u = Function(V)
u_1, u_2, u_3 = split(u)
!ec
These functions will be used to represent the unknowns $u_1$, $u_2$, and $u_3$
at the new time level $n+1$. The corresponding values at the previous
time level $n$ are denoted by `u_n1`, `u_n2`, and `u_n3` in our program.

When now all functions and test functions have been defined, we can
express the nonlinear variational problem
(ref{ftu1:reactionsystem:varproblem}):

!bc pycod
F = ((u_1 - u_n1) / k)*v_1*dx + dot(w, grad(u_1))*v_1*dx \
  + eps*dot(grad(u_1), grad(v_1))*dx + K*u_1*u_2*v_1*dx  \
  + ((u_2 - u_n2) / k)*v_2*dx + dot(w, grad(u_2))*v_2*dx \
  + eps*dot(grad(u_2), grad(v_2))*dx + K*u_1*u_2*v_2*dx  \
  + ((u_3 - u_n3) / k)*v_3*dx + dot(w, grad(u_3))*v_3*dx \
  + eps*dot(grad(u_3), grad(v_3))*dx - K*u_1*u_2*v_3*dx + K*u_3*v_3*dx \
  - f_1*v_1*dx - f_2*v_2*dx - f_3*v_3*dx
!ec

The time-stepping simply consists of solving this variational problem
in each time step by a call to the `solve` function:

!bc pycod
t = 0
for n in range(num_steps):
    t += dt
    timeseries_w.retrieve(w.vector(), t)
    solve(F == 0, u)
    u_n.assign(u)
!ec
In each time step, we first read the current value for the velocity
field from the time series we have previously stored. We then solve
the nonlinear system, and assign the computed values to the left-hand
side values for the next time interval.

The solution at the final time is shown in Figure
ref{ftut1:fig:reactionsystem:solution}. We
clearly see the advection of the species $A$ and $B$ and the formation
of $C$ along the center of the channel where $A$ and $B$ meet.

The complete code is presented below.

Finally, we comment on three important techniques that are very useful
when working with systems of PDEs: setting initial conditions, setting
boundary conditions, and extracting components of the system for
plotting or postprocessing.

===== Setting initial conditions for mixed systems =====

In our example, we did not need to worry about setting an initial
condition, since we start with $u_1 = u_2 = u_3 = 0$. This happens
automatically in the code when we set `u_n = Function(V)`. This
creates a `Function` for the whole system and all degrees of freedom
are set to zero.

If we want to set initial conditions for the components of the
system separately, the easiest solution is to define the initial
conditions as a vector-valued `Expression` and then
project this to the `Function` representing the whole system. For
example,

!bc pycod
u_0 = Expression(('sin(x[0])', 'cos(x[0]*x[1])', 'exp(x[1])'), degree=1)
u_n = project(u_0, V)
!ec
This defines $u_1$, $u_2$, and $u_2$ to be the projections of $\sin
x$, $\cos (xy)$, and $\exp(y)$, respectively.

===== Setting boundary conditions for mixed systems =====

In our example, we also did not need to worry about setting boundary
conditions since we used a natural Neumann condition. If we want to set
Dirichlet conditions for individual components of the system, this can
be done as usual by the class `DirichletBC`, but we must specify for
which subsystem we set the boundary condition. For example, to specify
that $u_2$ should be equal to $xy$ on the boundary defined by
`boundary`, we do

!bc
u_D = Expression('x[0]*x[1]', degree=1)
bc = DirichletBC(V.sub(1), u_D, boundary)
!ec
The object `bc` or a list of such objects containing different
boundary conditions, can then be passed to the `solve` function as usual.
Note that numbering starts at $0$ in FEniCS so the subspace
corresponding to $u_2$ is `V.sub(1)`.

===== Accessing components of mixed systems =====

If `u` is a `Function` defined on a mixed function space in FEniCS,
there are several ways in which `u` can be *split* into components.
Above we already saw an example of the first of these:

!bc pycod
u_1, u_2, u_3 = split(u)
!ec
This extracts the components of `u` as *symbols* that can be used in a
variational problem. The above statement is in fact equivalent to

!bc pycod
u_1 = u[0]
u_2 = u[1]
u_3 = u[2]
!ec
Note that `u[0]` is not really a `Function` object, but merely a
symbolic expression, just like `grad(u)` in FEniCS is a symbolic
expression and not a `Function` representing the gradient.  This means
that `u_1`, `u_2`, `u_3` can be used in a variational problem, but
cannot be used for plotting or postprocessing.

To access the components of `u` for plotting and saving the solution
to file, we need to use a different variant of the `split` function:

!bc pycod
_u_1, _u_2, _u_3 = u.split()
!ec
This returns three subfunctions as actual objects with access to the
common underlying data stored in `u`, which makes plotting and saving
to file possible. Alternatively, we can do

!bc pycod
_u_1, _u_2, _u_3 = u.split(deepcopy=True)
!ec
which will create `_u_1`, `_u_2`, and `u_3` as stand-alone `Function`
objects, each holding a copy of the subfunction data extracted from
`u`. This is useful in many situations but is not necessary for
plotting and saving solutions to file.
