======= Deflection of a membrane =======
label{ch:poisson0:membrane}

Our first FEniCS program for the Poisson equation targeted a
simple test problem where we could easily verify the
implementation. Now we turn our attention to a more physically
relevant problem in a non-trivial geometry, which results in
solutions of somewhat more exciting shape.

We want to compute the deflection $D(x,y)$ of a two-dimensional,
circular membrane or radius $R$, subject to a load $p$ over the
membrane. The appropriate PDE model is

!bt
\begin{equation}
-T\nabla^2 D = p(x,y)\quad\hbox{in }\Omega = \{ (x,y)\,\vert\, x^2+y^2\leq R\}\tp
\end{equation}
!et
Here, $T$ is the tension in the membrane (constant), and $p$ is the external
pressure load.
The boundary of the membrane has no
deflection, implying $D=0$ as boundary condition.
A localized load can be modeled as a Gaussian function:

!bt
\begin{equation}
p(x,y) = {A\over 2\pi\sigma}\exp{\left(
- {1\over2}\left( {x-x_0\over\sigma}\right)^2
- {1\over2}\left( {y-y_0\over\sigma}\right)^2
\right)}\, .
\end{equation}
!et
The parameter $A$ is the amplitude of the pressure,
$(x_0,y_0)$ the localization of the maximum point of the load,
and $\sigma$ the ``width'' of $p$.

===== Scaling the equation =====

The localization of the pressure, $(x_0,y_0)$, is for simplicity set
to $(0, R_0)$ with $0 < R_0 < R$. There are many physical parameters
in this problem, and we can benefit from grouping them by means of
scaling. Let us introduce dimensionless coordinates $\bar x = x/R$,
$\bar y = y/R$, and a dimensionless deflection $w=D/D_c$, where $D_c$
is a characteristic size of the deflection. Introducing $\bar
R_0=R_0/R$, we get

!bt
\[ -\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial\bar x^2}
-\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial\bar y^2}= \alpha
\exp{\left(
- \beta^2(\bar x^2
+ (\bar y-\bar R_0)^2)\right)}\hbox{ for } \bar x^2 + \bar y^2 < 1,\]
!et
where

!bt
\[ \alpha = \frac{R^2A}{2\pi T D_c\sigma},\quad\beta = \frac{R}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\tp\]
!et
With an appropriate scaling, $w$ and its derivatives are of size
unity, so the left-hand side of the scaled PDE is about unity in size,
while the right-hand side has $\alpha$ as its characteristic size.
This suggest choosing $\alpha$ to be unity, or around unity. We shall
in this particular case choose $\alpha=4$. (One can also find the
analytical solution in scaled coordinates and show that the maximum
deflection $D(0,0)$ is $D_c$ if we choose $\alpha=4$ to determine
$D_c$.) With $D_c=AR^2/(8\pi\sigma T)$ and dropping the bars we get
the scaled problem

!bt
\begin{equation}
-\nabla^2w = 4\exp{\left(
- \beta^2(x^2
+ (y-R_0)^2)\right)},
label{ch:poisson0:membrane:scaled:eq}
\end{equation}
!et
to be solved over the unit circle with $w=0$ on the boundary.  Now
there are only two parameters to vary: the dimensionless extent of the
pressure, $\beta$, and the localization of the pressure peak, $R_0\in
[0,1]$.  As $\beta\rightarrow 0$, we have a special case with solution
$w=1-x^2-y^2$.

Given a computed scaled solution $w$, the physical deflection can be computed by

!bt
\[ D = \frac{AR^2}{8\pi\sigma T}w\tp\]
!et

Just a few modifications are necessary in our previous program to solve
this new problem.

===== Defining the mesh =====

A mesh over the unit circle can be created by the `mshr` tool in
FEniCS:

!bc pyhid
from fenics import *
!ec

!bc pycod
from mshr import *
domain = Circle(Point(0.0, 0.0), 1.0)
mesh = generate_mesh(domain, 20)
!ec
The `Circle` shape from `mshr` takes the center and radius of the circle
as the two first arguments, while `n` is the resolution. The cell size
will be (approximately) equal to the diameter of the domain divided
by the resolution.

===== Defining the load =====

idx{`Expression`}
idx{Expression with parameters}

The right-hand side pressure function
is represented by an `Expression` object. There
are two physical parameters in the formula for $f$ that enter the
expression string and these parameters must have their values set
by keyword arguments:

!bc pycod
beta = 8
R0 = 0.6
p = Expression(
    '4*exp(-pow(beta, 2)*(pow(x[0], 2) + pow(x[1] - R0, 2)))',
    degree=1, beta=beta, R0=R0)
!ec
The coordinates in `Expression` objects *must* be a vector
`x` components `x[0]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]`, corresponding to
$x$, $y$, and $z$.
Otherwise we are free to introduce names of parameters as long as
these are given default values by keyword arguments. All the
parameters initialized by keyword arguments can at any time have their
values modified. For example, we may set

!bc pycod-t
p.beta = 12
p.R0 = 0.3
!ec

% if FORMAT == 'ipynb':
We also need to define a function space and boundary conditions:

!bc pyhid
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 2)

def u0_boundary(x, on_boundary):
    return on_boundary

u0 = Constant(0)
bc = DirichletBC(V, u0, u0_boundary)
!ec
% endif

idx{interpolation}

===== Defining the variational problem =====

The variational problem and the boundary conditions are the same as in
our first Poisson problem, but we may introduce `w` instead of `u` as
primary unknown and `p` instead of `f` as right-hand side function:

!bc pycod
w = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
a = dot(grad(w), grad(v))*dx
L = p*v*dx

w = Function(V)
solve(a == L, w, bc)
!ec

% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
# Avoid plot command in notebook. It easily makes the kernel freeze.

===== Plotting the solution =====

It is of interest to visualize the pressure $p$ along with the
deflection $w$ so that we can examine the membrane's response to the
pressure. We must then transform the formula (`Expression`) to a
finite element function (`Function`). The most natural approach is to
construct a finite element function whose degrees of freedom are
calculated from $p$. That is, we interpolate $p$:

!bc pycod
p = interpolate(p, V)
!ec
Note that the assignment to `p` destroys the previous `Expression`
object `p`, so if it is of interest to still have access to this
object, another name must be used for the `Function` object returned
by `interpolate`.

We can now plot `w` and `p` on the screen
as well as save the fields to a file in VTK format:

!bc pycod
plot(w, title='Deflection')
plot(p, title='Load')

vtkfile_w = File('poisson_membrane/deflection.pvd')
vtkfile_w << w
vtkfile_p = File('poisson_membrane/load.pvd')
vtkfile_p << p
!ec
Figure ref{ch:poisson0:membrane:fig} shows the result of the `plot` commands.

===== Making curve plots through the domain =====

idx{curve plots}

# Nice with some matplotlib plots in notebooks...and very useful for
# scientific investigations.

The best way to compare the load and the deflection is to make a curve plot
along the line $x=0$. This is just a matter of defining a set of points
along the line and evaluating the finite element functions `w` and `p`
at these points:

% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
@@@CODE vol1/python/poisson_membrane.py fromto: # Curve plot@# Hold
This example program can be found in the file `${prog["poisson_membrane"]}.py`.

The resulting curve plot appears in Figure
ref{ch:poisson0:membrane:fig2}. The localized input ($p$) is heavily
damped and smoothed in the output ($w$). This reflects a typical
property of the Poisson equation.

===== Visualizing the solution in ParaView =====
label{ftut:paraview}

idx{ParaView}

"ParaView": "http://www.paraview.org" is a powerful
tool for visualizing scalar and vector fields, including those
computed by FEniCS.

Our program writes the fields $w$ and $p$ to file as finite element
functions. We choose the names of these files to be
`membrane_deflection.pvd` for $w$ and `membrane_load.pvd` for $p$.
These files are in VTK format and their data can be visualized in
ParaView. We now give a detailed account for how to visualize
the fields $w$ and $p$ in ParaView.

 o Start the ParaView application.
 o Open a file with _File - Open..._. You will see a list of `.pvd` and
   `.vtu` files. More specifically you will see `membrane_deflection.pvd`.
   Choose this file.
 o Click on _Apply_ to the left (*Properties* pane) in the GUI, and
   ParaView will visualize the contents of the file, here as a color image.
 o To get rid of the axis in the lower left corner of the plot area
   and axis cross in the middle of the circle, find the *Show Orientation Axis* and *Show Center* buttons to the right in the second row of buttons at the top of the GUI. Click on these buttons to toggle axis information on/off.
 o If you want a color bar to explain the mapping between $w$ values and colors,
   go to the *Color Map Editor* in the right of the GUI and use the
   *Show/hide color legend* button. Alternatively, find *Coloring* in the
   lower left part of the GUI, and toggle the *Show* button.
 o The color map, by default going from blue (low values) to red (high values),
   can easily be changed. Find the *Coloring* menu in the left part of the
   GUI, click *Edit*, then in the *Color Map Editor* double click at the
   left end of the color spectrum and choose another color, say yellow, then
   double click at the right and of the spectrum and choose pink, scroll
   down to the bottom of the dialog and click *Update*. The color map now
   goes from yellow to pink.
 o To save the plot to file, click on _File - Export Scene..._,
   fill in a filename, and save.
   See Figure ref{ftut:paraview:figwp} (middle).
 o To change the background color of plots, choose
   _Edit - Settings..._, _Color_ tab, click on _Background Color_,
   and choose it to be, e.g., white. Then choose _Foreground Color_ to
   be something different.
 o To plot the mesh with colors reflecting the size of $w$, find the
   *Representation* drop down menu in the left part of the GUI, and replace
   *Surface* by *Wireframe*.
 o To overlay a surface plot with a wireframe plot, load $w$ and plot
   as surface, then load $w$ again and plot as wireframe. Make sure
   both icons in the *Pipeline Browser* in the left part of the GUI
   are *on* for the `membrane_deflection.pvd` files you want to display.
   See Figure ref{ftut:paraview:figwp} (left).
 o Redo the surface plot. Then we can add some contour lines.
   Press the semi-sphere icon in the third row of buttons at the top of the
   GUI (the so-called *filters*). A set of contour values can now be
   specified in a dialog box in the left part of the GUI. Remove
   the default contour (0.578808) and add 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05.
   Click *Apply* and see an overlay of white contour lines.
   In the *Pipeline Browser* you can click on the icons to turn
   a filter on or off.
 o Divide the plot window into two, say horizontally, using the top right
   small icon. Choose the _3D View_ button. Open a new file and load
   `membrane_load.pvd`. Click on _Apply_ to see a plot of the load.
 o To plot a 2D scalar field as a surface, load the field,
   click _Apply_ to plot it, then select
   from the _Filters_ pulldown menu the filter *Warp By Scalar*, click
   _Apply_, then toggle the _2D_ button to _3D_ in the Layout `#1`
   window (upper row of buttons in that window). Now you can rotate
   the figure. The height of the surface is very low, so go to the
   *Properties (Warp By Scalar1)* window to the left in the GUI and give
   a *Scale Factor* of 20 and re-click _Apply_
   to lift the surface by a factor of 20.
   Figure ref{ftut:paraview:figwp} (right) shows the result.

A particularly useful feature of ParaView is that you can record GUI clicks
(_Tools - Start/Stop Trace_) and
get them translated to Python code. This allows you automate the
visualization process. You can also make curve plots along lines through
the domain, etc.

===== Using the built-in visualization tool =====
label{ftut:quickviz}
idx{visualization} idx{plotting} idx{VTK}

This section explains some useful visualization features of the
built-in visualization tool in FEniCS.  The `plot` command applies the
VTK package to visualize finite element functions in a very quick and
simple way.  The command is ideal for debugging, teaching, and initial
scientific investigations.  The visualization can be interactive, or
you can steer and automate it through program statements. More
advanced and professional visualizations are usually better created
with advanced tools like Mayavi, ParaView, or VisIt.

idx{`plot`}

The `plot` function can take additional arguments, such as
a title of the plot, or a specification of a wireframe plot (elevated mesh)
instead of a colored surface plot:

!bc pycod
plot(mesh, title='Finite element mesh')
plot(w, wireframe=True, title='Solution')
!ec
Axes can be turned on by the `axes=True` argument, while
`interactive=True` makes the program hang at the plot command - you have
to type `q` in the plot window to terminate the plot and continue execution.

The left mouse button is used to rotate the surface, while the right
button can zoom the image in and out.  Point the mouse to the `Help`
text down in the lower left corner to get a list of all the keyboard
commands that are available.

The plots created by pressing `p` or `P` are stored in filenames
having the form `dolfin_plot_X.png` or `dolfin_plot_X.pdf`, where `X`
is an integer that is increased by one from the last plot that was
made. The file stem `dolfin_plot_` can be set to something more
suitable through the `hardcopy_prefix` keyword argument to the `plot`
function, for instance, `plot(f, hardcopy_prefix='pressure')`.

idx{rotate PDF plots}
idx{`pdftk`}

#Plots stored in PDF format need to be rotated 90 degrees before
#inclusion in documents. This can be done using the `pdftk` command:

#!bc sys
#Terminal> pdftk dolfin_plot_1.pdf cat 1-endnorth output out.pdf
#!ec

#For making plots in batch, we can do the following:

#!bc pycod
#viz_w = plot(w, interactive=False)
#viz_w.elevate(-10)  # adjust (lift) camera from the default view
#viz_w.plot(w)       # bring new settings into action
#viz_w.write_png('deflection')  # make deflection.png
#viz_w.write_pdf('deflection')  # make deflection.pdf
## Rotate pdf file (right) from landscape to portrait
#import os
#os.system('pdftk deflection.pdf cat 1-endnorth output w.pdf')
#!ec

The ranges of the color scale can be set by the `range_min` and `range_max`
keyword arguments to `plot`. The values must be `float` objects. These
arguments are important to keep fixed for animations in time-dependent
problems.

!bwarning Built-in plotting on Mac OS X and in Docker
The built-in plotting in FEniCS may not work as expected when either
running on Mac OS X or when running inside a FEniCS Docker container.
FEniCS supports plotting using the `plot` command on Mac OS
X. However, the keyboard shortcuts `h`, `p`, `P` and so on may fail
to work. When running inside a Docker container, plotting is not
supported since Docker does not interact with your windowing system.
For Docker users who need plotting, it is recommended to either work
within a Jupyter/FEniCS notebook (command `fenicsproject notebook`)
or rely on ParaView or other external tools for visualization.
