__Preface.__
This book gives a concise and gentle introduction to finite element
programming in Python based on the popular FEniCS software library.
The library delivers high performance since FEniCS automatically
delegates compute-intensive tasks to C++ by help of code
generation. We show in detail how to write finite element solvers for
the Poisson equation, the time-dependent diffusion equation, the
equations of elasticity, and the Navier--Stokes equations, in heterogeneous
media and with different types of boundary conditions.
#If a vol. 2, these comments are not so appropriate anymore:
#After having digested the examples in this tutorial, it should be easy
#to learn more from the more advanced FEniCS documentation and the
#numerous demo programs that come with the software.

This document is also available in
## Note: these are the official gh-pages documents, i.e., the original tutorial
## as long as we work in brief and do not merge gh-pages.
