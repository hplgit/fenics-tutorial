========= Mixed finite element programming =========
label{ch:mixedFEM}

========= High-performance computing =========
label{ch:HPC}

How to take an ordinary FEniCS program, profile it, optimize the code,
and turn into an HPC application for parallel platforms.

========= Multi-physics in multi-domains =========
label{ch:multiphys}

Systems of PDEs, coupling of domains, typically elasticity with a
larger domain for heat transfer, simple fluid-structure interaction?

========= Vol II ends here now =========

========= More old stuff =========
