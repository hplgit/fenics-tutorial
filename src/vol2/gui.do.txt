======= Creating a graphical user interface =======
label{ftut:gui}

Everything in this book is about solving PDEs by creating FEniCS programs.
The short set of powerful statements is what makes FEniCS so powerful.
Users of your FEniCS software can just set some variables and call
up your ready-made solver functions. However, some users will not be
at home with anything that needs to be programmed. In such cases you
want to offer a stand-alone application that is completely graphical.
This can be accomplished in a few lines of code using the
"Parampool": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool" tool.

We want to create a graphical application to solve $-\nabla^2 u=f$ in
2D, where the user can choose $f$ and $u_0$, the $N_x$ and $N_y$
divisions of the mesh, and the degree of the finite element
polynomials. In addition, the user may set *any* of DOLFIN's
collection of user-adjustable parameters (the `parameters`
dictionary). When the PDE is solved, we should see a plot of the
solution and have a link to the VTK solution file.
This minimalistic application is created in a about one page of Python code.

The "Parampool documentation": "http://hplgit.github.io/parampool/doc/web/index.html" explains how to wrap Python solvers with different types of
user interfaces: command-line, commands in a file, or a graphical web
interface. Here we just list the necessary steps.

===== Making a pool of parameters =====

Parampool requires the user to make a module, typically called `compute.py`,
with two functions, one defining a data tree structure for all input
parameters that can be adjusted in the user interface, and one function
for computing the solution and returning HTML code with the results to
be displayed.

===== Make a compute function =====

@@@CODE src/gui/compute.py fromto: import sys@

===== Multiple parameters objects =====

With `from fenics import *` comes the `parameters` database that we
have worked with so far. However, one may have several such databases
in a program. For example, suppose we want to have separate iterative
solvers for two PDE problems in a program:

!bc pycod
solver_u = KrylovSolver()
solver_v = KrylovSolver()
!ec
Each of `solver_u` and `solver_v` now has a `parameters` database
(`solver_u.parameters` and `solver_v.parameters`)
with parameters for setting parameters in the iterative solvers. How can
we get also these two `parameters` objects into our GUI?

The recommended approach is that you dump all parameters objects to
separate XML files:

!bc pycod
file = File('solver_u.xml')
file << solver_u.parameters
file = File('solver_u.xml')
file << solver_u.parameters

myprm = Parameters('My parameters')
myprm.add('some parameter', value)
...
file = File('myprm.xml')
file << myprm
!ec
In the function where you create the pool object (`define_pool`),
you can call
`fenicsxml2pool` for the relevant XML files at the relevant
locations in the pool tree. These actions build up the entire pool.
In the compute function, you need to call `pool.traverse` for
the various parameters objects in the solver. It is easy to fill
the `fenics.parameters` object since we get access to that object through
the `fenics` module, but local parameter objects like `solver_u`
are not trivial to access from the compute function. The best solution
is to have the solver available as a class. With an object of this
class inside the compute function, and with all parameter objects as
attributes in the class, we can easily call `pool.traverse` for
each parameter object of interest.
